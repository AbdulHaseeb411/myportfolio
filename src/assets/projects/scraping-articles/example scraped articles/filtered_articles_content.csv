The Mexican band Maná has decided to withdraw its collaboration with reggaeton artist Nicky Jam, the song De pies a cabeza, from all streaming platforms in response to the Puerto Rican’s public support for former president Donald Trump during his campaign. This action has been widely commented on and is relevant within the context of the growing political polarization in the music industry.
The song De pies a cabeza, released in August 2016, was a notable success and reached the top spot on Billboard’s Latin Airplay chart. However, the relationship between Maná and Nicky Jam has suffered a major blow due to the reggaetonero’s recent political stance. Maná, known for its strong support of Latino rights and opposition to policies they consider detrimental to the community, decided to pull the song after the singer expressed his support for Trump at a recent rally in Las Vegas.
In a statement published on Instagram, the Mexican band clearly expressed its disapproval of Trump’s positions and Nicky Jam’s support for the former president. The message reads: “For the past 30 years, Maná has supported and defended the rights of Latinos around the world. There is no business or promotion that is worth more than the dignity of our people. That is why today Maná decided to pull its collaboration with Nicky Jam De pies a cabeza from all digital platforms.” The statement also included a banner stating, “We don’t work with racists,” underscoring the band’s position on ideologies they consider discriminatory.
The controversy escalated when Trump, at a campaign event, made a mistake by referring to Nick Rivera Caminero, Nicky Jam’s birth name, as a woman before correcting himself and introducing him at his rally. This incident went viral and generated an embarrassing moment for the singer, who, despite the mistake, continued his support for the former president.
Rivera Caminero, for his part, has been vocal in his endorsement of Trump, mentioning at the rally that it was an honor to meet the former president and asking those in attendance to vote for him. Other Latino artists such as Anuel AA and Justin Quiles have also shown support for Trump, highlighting the divide within the Latino music community over American politics.
Maná, throughout its career, has maintained an active political stance, especially on issues related to Latino rights. The band has openly criticized Trump and supported Democratic candidates who promote immigration reform and inclusive policies. Their support for Joe Biden in the 2020 election and their rejection of Trump’s policies reflect their political stance.
The controversy has also led Rivera Caminero to delete the publication in which he appeared with Trump from his social networks, although it has not been publicly explained whether this action is related to Maná's decision. The removal of the song illustrates the tension between artistic values and political leanings, and shows how music has become a battleground for broader cultural and political debates. For example, several American and foreign artists —such as Jack White, Eddy Grant and Elton John — have opposed the use of their songs by the Trump campaign without permission."

Political scientists often talk about the “October surprise,” meaning an unexpected event or revelation that emerges shortly before the November election and can change the course of the campaign. This year, however, there have been surprises in June, July, August and September, many of them momentous enough to go down in the annals of history. The latest incident at Donald Trump’s golf club in Florida, which the authorities are treating as an assassination attempt, has once again shaken up a campaign in which the polls indicate a technical tie between the Republican candidate and his Democratic rival, Kamala Harris. The Republicans, who mostly reacted with a message of unity after the first assassination attempt, have now rushed to blame the Democrats.
On June 27, the most consequential presidential debate in American political history took place. It revealed that President Joe Biden was too old to run for re-election. Then, with Biden still refusing to throw in the towel, the attack in Butler, Pennsylvania, took place, in which a gunman shot Trump from a rooftop while the candidate was at a rally. A bullet hit him in the ear, although it could have killed him. Trump reacted by raising his fist in the air as a trickle of blood ran down his face. That iconic image increased his lead in the polls.
The week after the attack, the Republican convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin ratified a triumphant Trump as their nominee even as Biden realized that he was not in a position to compete with him. This triggered another historic turn in the campaign. The president withdrew from the race and and handed over the baton to Kamala Harris, who quickly garnered the support of the entire party. In August, the Democratic convention crowned her as the presidential candidate, becoming the first nominee since 1968 who has not gone through the primaries system.
The enthusiasm generated by the change allowed Harris to take the lead in the popular vote polls, but the election will depend on tens or hundreds of thousands of votes in a handful of decisive states and there, the swords are still high. The previous milestone of the campaign, the debate between Harris and Trump last Tuesday in Philadelphia, seems to have barely moved the needle in terms of voting intention, even though all serious polls show the Democratic contender as the undisputed winner.
As Trump stewed in his own frustration — declaring himself the winner of the debate while blaming the moderators for losing it — he took a break from campaigning in Florida, where he usually resides. On Sunday morning, he had tweeted on Truth, his social network, “I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT” (in capital letters), after the artist announced her support for Harris following the debate. He then went to play golf, his favorite sport, at his club. That was when the shooting incident took place.
Secret Service agents tasked with protecting the former president spotted a suspicious person hiding in the bushes with a rifle while Trump was golfing. The officers opened fire. The suspect, later identified by authorities as Ryan Wesley Routh, 58, a man with a criminal record and an obsession with Ukraine, got into his vehicle and drove away but was stopped at a roadblock. Agents found a semi-automatic rifle with a scope in the perimeter of the compound.
Although Trump thanked the authorities for their “absolutely exceptional” work, the new attempt to assassinate Trump raises questions about the work of the Secret Service. The attack was prevented and the failures were not as obvious as they were in Butler, but the fact that a person in possession of a rifle with a scope could have been so close to Trump calls into question once again the effectiveness of the protection.
The political consequences of this second assassination attempt are highly uncertain. The first attack favored the former president in the polls and prediction markets, which have barely budged this time. Compared with the shooting of Butler in July, in which a bullet slightly wounded him in the ear and the secret service had to evacuate him from the stage of the rally while the incident was being broadcast live, this second attempt lacked that drama.
Trump emerged from the first attack as a hero. This time there were no images of the former president, who was playing golf. It is also unclear how much danger he was in. Being the victim of an attempted attack usually increases citizens’ empathy and feelings of solidarity with the target of the attack. On the other hand, Trump has embraced and defended some episodes of political violence (such as the assault on the Capitol) and has been a divisive and polarizing figure in American politics.
On Monday, as he left the White House for an event in Philadelphia, Biden called on Congress to approve more resources for security. “One thing I want to make clear is that the [Secret] Service needs more help. And I think Congress should respond to their need,” he said, before adding: “Thank God the president is fine,” referring to Trump.
Vice President Kamala Harris on Sunday condemned political violence and said she was “deeply disturbed” by the attempted assassination of her rival. “As we gather the facts, I will be clear: I condemn political violence. We must all do our part to ensure this incident does not lead to more violence,” Harris said in a statement. “As President Biden has said, our Administration will ensure the Secret Service has all the resources, capabilities, and protective measures necessary to carry out its critical mission,” she added.
The Republican response has been aggressive. “You are so full of shit. You are not glad he is safe, it is your rhetoric that caused this, AGAIN!!!!!” tweeted Dan Scavino Jr., a senior adviser to Trump’s campaign. There have been many other voices in the Republican Party blaming Democrats for the attempted attack. “The radical left has continued to label Republicans and Americans who simply want a safe and prosperous country as ‘threats to democracy.’ This irresponsible rhetoric is hurting people,” tweeted Anna Paulina Luna, a congresswoman from Florida.
“This rhetoric against President Trump, this narrative that he will be the next dictator, that he is the next Hitler coming, it has got to stop. Enough is enough,” Florida Rep. Mike Waltz told Fox News on Sunday. “And when you have this narrative coming from the left, from [the] media, from elected officials, even, that Trump has to be stopped by any means necessary, it shouldn’t surprise anyone that these people are being radicalized and taking action like this,” he added. Meanwhile, the richest man in the world, the tycoon Elon Musk, a Trump ally who routinely spreads hoaxes, has wondered on his social platform why no one is trying to assassinate Biden or Harris. He later deleted the message.

Her family had decided to move her to New York after she was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s so she could receive better treatment than she could get on the island, where the health system is in a crisis. “Until she lay down and took her last breath, she always said, ‘I have land and I have a home, and I want to go back,’” Rivera recounts. Like her grandmother, many of the six million Puerto Ricans in the diaspora in the United States dream of setting foot in their country again, but the reality on the island dissuades them: an electrical grid in pieces, closed schools, gentrified neighborhoods, mismanaged public funds...
That is why Rivera decided to found last June La Brega y Fuerza, an initiative that seeks to mobilize the Puerto Rican diaspora throughout the United States to exercise their right to vote in the presidential elections on November 5, a privilege that is denied to those residing in the U.S. territory. This way, the Puerto Rican electorate in states such as Florida, where 1.2 million Puerto Ricans reside, New York (with almost one million) or Pennsylvania (500,000), can amplify the concerns of their compatriots on the island.
“We need to build a pipeline of power that connects people on the island to the diaspora in a more profound way,” Rivera synthesizes. That diaspora has been growing exponentially since 2017, the year Hurricane Maria devastated the island and forced a mass exodus to the U.S. mainland. The arrival of thousands of Puerto Ricans since then to states like Pennsylvania, Florida, North Carolina, Georgia and New York has given them significant political influence, especially within the coveted Latino vote, since, as U.S. citizens, as soon as they settle in the country they are eligible to vote, unlike other Latin American immigrants.
This reality has not escaped Kamala Harris nor Donald Trump. Both candidates have recently redoubled their efforts to appeal to the Puerto Rican electorate, especially in the key state of Pennsylvania, where 80% of the Latino vote is Puerto Rican. Recently, the Republican and Democratic campaigns held rallies in the state within a week of each other in which they explicitly sought to appeal to Puerto Rican voters.
In Trump’s case, the former president invited to his rally in Johnstown (Pennsylvania) last August 30 two unusual characters: Puerto Rican reggaeton artists Anuel AA and Justin Quiles. “Gentlemen, get up here quick because I don’t know if these people know who the hell they are, but it’s good for the Puerto Rican vote. All Puerto Ricans are going to vote for Trump now,” said the Republican candidate as he introduced the singers. Both wore caps with the Republican candidate’s signature phrase, Make America Great Again, and made it clear why they had come to the rally. “The world knows that the best president this country has ever seen is named Donald Trump,” Anuel assured. “A lot of us Latinos are standing strong with Trump,” Quiles added. Since then, Nicky Jam, another Puerto Rican reggaetonero, also showed his support for the Republican at a rally where Trump mistakenly introduced him as a “hot” woman.
A week later, some 200 miles away, it was the Democrats’ turn. Last September 7, in Allentown, one of the cities with the highest proportion of Latino voters in Pennsylvania, the “second gentleman” and husband of Kamala Harris, Douglas Emhoff, was greeted at the first Democratic campaign rally dedicated to the Latino community with banners reading “Boricuas con Harris-Walz” (Puerto Ricans with Harris-Walz). He was accompanied by Miguel Cardona, Secretary of Education and the only Puerto Rican in President Joe Biden’s cabinet. Cardona highlighted his Puerto Rican background, identifying himself as a proud grandson of Puerto Rican farmers who, he recounted, told him that to have a good harvest, you have to know how to plant seeds. “Planting seeds for the future generation is what the Harris-Walz ticket is all about,” he said.
For experts and community organizers, it was time for both parties to recognize the importance of this electorate, especially in Pennsylvania, where there are 500,000 Latinos registered to vote and 400,000 of them are Puerto Rican. Nilda Ruiz, president of the National Puerto Rican Agenda and the Philadelphia-based Asociación Puertorriqueños en Marcha, explains that the key is in the numbers. “Considering those 400,000 voters and seeing the very small margin by which Biden won in 2020 (81,660 votes) and by which Hillary Clinton lost in 2016 (44,292), if we can activate the Puerto Rican vote, we can change the elections in favor of what we want,” she says.
“Many say that Puerto Ricans don’t vote in large numbers, but it’s because there have been no incentives,” Ruiz adds, referring to previous elections in which Puerto Rican turnout has been low, according to various studies and exit polls. “If we can educate people about the policies that affect Puerto Ricans in Puerto Rico and here, they become more motivated to vote,” she says.
Jimmy Torres Vélez, vice president of the National Puerto Rican Agenda, agrees. “If we go out to vote we have the ability to tip the scales,” notes the also leader of Llamado Boricua, a new initiative aimed at educating and encouraging Puerto Ricans in Florida to vote. “Of the nearly 1.2 million Puerto Ricans in Florida, there must be 900,000 who are of voting age and meet all the requirements,” Torres Velez points out. In 2020 Trump carried this state by 371,686 votes and in 2016 by only 112,911. Therefore, despite the fact that many take for granted the fact that Florida has become Republican territory, the unionist highlights that the Puerto Rican vote is still key and deserves more attention.
On this last point, Torres Vélez emphasizes that while both campaigns are fighting for Pennsylvania, community organizers in Florida feel that the Democratic Party has forgotten about them. While it is true that this state, historically considered a deciding territory for any White House hopeful, has been leaning more to the right in recent years, Torres Vélez insists that Democrats cannot simply “throw their hands up in the air.”
Although Puerto Ricans tend to vote blue, in states like Florida they are increasingly voting red. “Many Puerto Ricans I know are Republicans because when they moved to Florida there was nothing else,” Torres Vélez points out. For him, the problem lies in that Democrats don’t want to invest in the state because they don’t see it feasible to win there. “It’s a mentality of: ‘I invest if I win, but since I don’t win, I don’t invest,’” he explains. “But you can’t forget about Florida even if you lose. We have to break that vicious circle,” he stresses.
“The Democrats are naturally more like us because their policies are aimed more at helping our people. The other side, with their actions, what they do is ridicule and disrespect us constantly. They look for a trap singer, bring him out on a stage and say ‘I don’t know who this guy is, but he’s going to give us the Puerto Rican vote.’ That is not the conversation we want or need to have,” says the leader of Llamado Boricua.
As important, if not more important, than getting both parties to pay attention to the Puerto Rican electorate is educating these voters about the U.S. electoral system and registering them to participate. “The most important thing is to know how to approach voters,” says Natascha Otero-Santiago, founder of the Boricuas con Kamala campaign, who has been organizing the Puerto Rican vote for Democrats since Barack Obama’s candidacy.
Otero-Santiago explains that “there are different Puerto Rican diasporas” that are characterized by “the amount of time they have spent in the United States.” For example, most Puerto Ricans in Florida arrived in the state in the last five to 10 years, while Puerto Ricans in New York have been arriving since the second half of the last century. Therefore, these new voters in Florida know less about how elections work in the country, since the procedures are different on the island, and they need to be taught more about it. “It’s important to pay attention to those nuances,” Otero-Santiago says.
Organizations such as La Brega y Fuerza have taken on this task in communities in New York, Pennsylvania and North Carolina. “We have created several programs in areas where there is a high density or large population of Puerto Rican voters to help them register and persuade them to make their voices heard,” Rivera said. In addition, the group is preparing a series of resources to disseminate that will explain each candidate’s policies on issues affecting the Puerto Rican community on and off the island.
Another entity working to mobilize these communities is Boricua Vota, led by Torres Vélez from Florida. The activist, who has been advocating for Puerto Rico and its diasporas for 40 years, explains that the goal is to elevate to the national conversation “what is in the best interest of us as Puerto Ricans and us as puertorriqueños, because there is a difference. When we live here we are guided by a set of particular interests — access to education, affordable housing, among others — but we also have a commitment because we sleep here but we dream of Puerto Rico,” he says. “Our heart is in Puerto Rico, so we have to make sure that the federal government’s policies are beneficial to the island.”

"https://english.elpais.com/usa/2024-09-16/no-theyre-not-eating-dogs-or-cats-the-real-situation-of-haitian-migrants-in-the-united-states.html","2024-09-16","No, they’re not eating dogs or cats: The real situation of Haitian migrants in the United States","In 2023, more than 731,000 Haitians were living in the diaspora in the U.S. According to NGOs, 227 deportation flights were made to the country between 2021 and 2022","The latest furor in the United States is over whether Haitian migrants are eating pets or not. This claim made by Donald Trump at the presidential debate on Tuesday — which was watched by more than 67 million people — was all it took for analysts to rush to check the facts, the media to flood Springfield authorities with calls about the accusation, social media users to create a horde of offensive AI images of Haitians running after Trump as he carries an armful of cats, gullible Republicans to ramp up protection for their pets and memes to joke that Haitians — and by extension all migrants — are people capable of anything. Amid all this noise, no one mentioned the fact that Haitians are one of the most displaced people in the world, and that since 2010, more than half a million have left their country.
In the presidential debate, Trump turned the tragic issue of immigration into a farce. He said that in Springfield, a small city that has welcomed almost 20,000 immigrants in the last four years, many of them Haitians, are eating pets. “They’re eating the dogs — the people that came in, they’re eating the cats. They’re eating the pets of the people that live there,” he said.
J. D. Vance, Trump’s running mate, made this same accusation to attack Kamala Harris and the Biden administration’s policy at the southern border. “Reports now show that people have had their pets abducted and eaten by people who shouldn’t be in this country. Where is our border czar?” he posted on X on September 9. Indeed, after the debate, Vance has continued to repeat the false claim and made clear that he plans on sticking to the story, regardless of whether or not it is true. “The American media totally ignored this stuff until Donald Trump and I started talking about cat memes. If I have to create stories so that the American media actually pays attention to the suffering of the American people, then that’s what I’m going to do,” he told CNN’s Dana Bash on Sunday.
When asked if he had made up the story, Vance said that it was based on “the firsthand account of my constituents.” “I say that we’re creating a story, meaning we’re creating the American media focusing on it,” he added. “I didn’t create 20,000 illegal migrants coming into Springfield thanks to Kamala Harris’s policies. Her policies did that.”
Following the statements, the Haitian government condemned the “discriminatory statements” of the Republican candidate and other members of his party, and insisted that “unfortunately, this is not the first time that compatriots abroad have fallen victim to disinformation campaigns, been stigmatized and dehumanized to serve electoral political interests.” The statement stressed that such comments “undermine the dignity of our compatriots and could endanger their lives.”
Organizations have long called on the United States to end its racist treatment of Haitian asylum seekers. A 2023 Amnesty International report said Haitian migrants are particularly affected by racism, xenophobia and systematic violence. Erika Guevara Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International, said at the time that “racist migration and asylum policies only exacerbate the harm” inflicted on these people.
Today, figures suggest that one-sixth of Haitians live outside the country. In 2023, more than 731,000 Haitians were living in the United States, the fifth-largest foreign-born population in the U.S., representing 16% of the 4.6 million Caribbean immigrants, the largest number after Cubans, Dominicans and Jamaicans.
The crisis in Haiti did not begin with the violence, internal displacement and gang attacks in February, nor with the assassination of president Jovenel Moïse in 2021, but rather is a systemic and long-standing problem, stemming from the plunder and neglect of a country that has been ravaged by natural disasters and hit by constant economic crises. Amid this backdrop, the Biden administration has increased deportation flights to Haiti. According to Witness at the Border, around 227 deportation flights took place between 2021 and May 2022, a considerable number compared to the 37 flights recorded in 2020 and the 37 recorded in the first eight months of 2021. Witness at the Border reported that, between December 2022 and January 2024, the United States sent one deportation flight per month to Haiti.
Haitian-Canadian lawyer Gabrielle Apollon, coordinator of the Hemispheric Network for Haitian Migrants’ Rights, told EL PAÍS that it is essential to “contextualize the issue of Haitian migration and recognize it as a problem for the entire hemisphere, which needs solutions from everyone.” “Haitians are fleeing violence in their country and heading to the United States, but they are also seeking refuge throughout Latin America, including Mexico, Brazil, Chile, and the entire Caribbean. As this is the year that marks the 40th anniversary of the Cartagena Declaration, there is an urgent need for the signatory countries to recognize Haitians as deserving of protection as refugees,” Apollon said, in reference to the non-binding regional instrument for adopting refugees signed by 10 Latin American countries.
The worsening humanitarian crisis in Haiti has led to a spike in Haitians fleeing the country, with many arriving in the United States irregularly. Although the Biden administration implemented pathways to help Haitians arrive in the country legally — such as humanitarian parole, the Haitian Family Reunification Parole Program resumed in 2022, or Temporary Protected Status (TPS) — the desperate situation on the Caribbean island is forcing people to flee by irregular routes that often pose a danger to their lives.
From 2019 to 2021, Haitians made up the majority of the migrants crossing the Darien jungle, and in 2022 and 2023, they were among the top three nationalities to undertake the risky journey. In 2023, 46,422 Haitians entered the United States, up 107% from 2022 figures, according to data from the International Organization for Migration (IOM). But Haitians are not only entering over land: in fiscal year 2022, the Coast Guard intercepted nearly 7,200 Haitians at sea and more than 5,000 in the first months of 2023. Many have drowned on these routes.
According to data from the United Nations Population Division, the United States was the main destination for Haitian migrants in 2020, followed by the Dominican Republic, Chile, Canada, France and Brazil. In the United States, Haitian migrants live mostly in the states of Florida, New York, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Georgia.
Today, many remain in Mexico waiting for their appointment with CBP One, a process that can take months and also puts them in a vulnerable situation. Indeed, Haitians suffer discrimination at every point of their journey. An Amnesty International report warned that the CBP One cell phone application placed Haitians at a disadvantage, “as they may face a higher risk of experiencing racial discrimination and violence in northern Mexico, where they are systematically excluded from shelters, forcing them to live in camps with cruel conditions and exposing them to greater danger.” The organization also points out that they have faced difficulties with the app’s facial recognition technology that struggles to recognize Black faces. Likewise, several Haitian migrants have claimed to have been mistreated in US detention centers.
The problem of discriminatory U.S. immigration policies towards Haitian nationals is not new. In the 1990s, Haitians were discriminated against and blamed for the spread of HIV. In 2021, a border guard on horseback was seen whipping Haitian migrants in the town of Del Rio, an image that immediately brought back memories of slavery in the U.S. Despite Biden’s restrictive policies to stop migrant arrivals at the border, U.S. authorities encountered Haitians more than 76,100 times in fiscal year 2023. Washington’s latest joint efforts with the Panama government to stop the migrants crossing the Darien jungle have slowed the flows: according to a recent report, so far this year, Haiti is the fifth country of origin for people crossing the jungle, behind Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador and China.

"https://english.elpais.com/usa/elections/2024-09-16/fbi-investigating-apparent-attempted-assassination-on-trump-at-his-florida-golf-club.html","2024-09-16","FBI investigating apparent ‘attempted assassination’ on Trump at his Florida golf club","Police have detained a suspect, identified by the media as Ryan Routh, 58, and found an assault rifle with a scope in the bushes around the compound","Fifty days before the U.S. election, Republican candidate Donald Trump has been the victim of a new attack that the FBI is investigating as “an attempted assassination.” The incident occurred at the Trump International Golf Course in West Palm Beach, where the former president was playing a round.
The apparent assassination attempt on Sunday comes just nine weeks after Trump was shot at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, in July. On that occasion, the attacker, Matthew Crooks, 20, was shot dead by Secret Servive agents. It was the first attack on a sitting president or presidential candidate in four decades.
At his golf club, the presidential hopeful was walking between the fifth and sixth holes when his Secret Service escort spotted a rifle barrel coming out of a perimeter fence. Secret Service agents fired shots from a distance, and the man fled in a vehicle. It is not yet known whether the alleged attacker ever opened fire.
“We were able to locate a witness, who came to us and said, ‘I saw the guy running out of the bushes. He jumped into a black Nissan, and I took a picture of the vehicle and the tag,’ which was great,” Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said at a news conference. Thanks to the photo, officers located the vehicle and arrested the driver, who, according to police statements, was calm and unarmed.
The man arrested is Ryan Wesley Routh, 58, a construction worker from Hawaii. The suspect has a criminal record for minor offenses. On his social media accounts — now deactivated, but which he used frequently — he appeared to express great interest in the war in Ukraine. According to his social media profile, he had voted for Trump in 2016, but was registered as an independent.
The FBI is still investigating the motive for the apparent attempted murder. Authorities found two backpacks hidden in the bushes at the golf club, as well as an AK-47 style assault rifle and scope. A Go-Pro camera was also discovered, prompting speculation that the suspect intended to record or livestream their actions.
Trump confirmed that he is “safe and well” and suffered no injuries. In a statement to supporters, the former president said that he is more committed than ever to continuing his run for the White House. “My resolve is only stronger after another attempt on my life. I will never slow down. I will never give up,” he said in the statement.
In a statement, the White House said that both President Joe Biden and Vice President and presidential candidate Kamala Harris were aware of the events and would remain updated on developments in the investigation.
As I have said many times, there is no place for political violence or for any violence ever in our country, and I have directed my team to continue to ensure that Secret Service has every resource, capability and protective measure necessary to ensure the former President’s…
“I am relieved to know that the former president is unharmed. There is an active investigation into this incident as law enforcement gathers more details about what happened,” President Biden said in a statement released Sunday night. “As I have said many times, there is no place for political violence or for any violence ever in our country, and I have directed my team to continue to ensure that the Secret Service has every resource, capability, and protective measures necessary to ensure the former president’s continued safety.”
“I have been briefed on reports of gunshots fired near former president Trump and his property in Florida and I am glad he is safe,” said Harris in a message on X. “Violence has no place in America.”

"https://english.elpais.com/international/2024-09-15/kids-who-migration-left-behind-the-challenging-rescue-of-children-who-have-been-victims-of-violence-in-mexico.html","2024-09-15","Kids who migration left behind: The challenging rescue of children who have been victims of violence in Mexico","Advocate Fabiola Mancilla has brought 25 minors who have been separated from their parents and left in vulnerable situations over to the United States","Eva Clemente was born in Cuba Libre, a town of just over 700 inhabitants where “women are not free.” Those aren’t my words, they’re hers. Clemente’s father sold her for food when she was 12 years old to another family from the municipality of Xalpatlahuac, in the Mexican state of Guerrero. She was only allowed to return home on the day her father died, after getting permission to attend his funeral. Now, in a room in her new apartment in the Bronx, the only photo that hangs on the wall is that of her dad, an older man in a sombrero and plaid shirt who Clemente says she understands, despite everything.
“My father wanted to find me a place for when he was no longer around,” she says. “He wanted to leave me in good hands. But that’s not what happened, he left me in the hands of worthless people. People who made my life miserable from the ages of 12 to 26.”
That’s why the day her mother-in-law called New York from Mexico and told her that she was going to sell her 14-year-old daughter, Clemente planned the girl’s escape, along with that of her five-year-old son, who Clemente had left in the care of their grandmother the day she departed for the United States. In Ñuu Savi, the “town of rain,” paternal families had the power to decide the fate of their women. “I was a servant in their home. I was not the daughter-in-law,” she says.
Sixteen years later, Clemente remembers the sharp sensation of the chile de árbol on the day her father sold her. They gave her a handful to grind as a test, an examination, a confirmation of the fact that she would be a good woman for their children. “It is very difficult to grind chile de árbol, because it is so spicy,” she says. “I had to hide so that I didn’t cry in front of the lady.”
No one saw Clemente cry from the heat, and so she moved to her new family’s house. After a time, she got together with one of their sons, who was two years older than her. Then she got pregnant. “We thought that things were going to go so well, but that wasn’t the case,” she says. “The father of my daughter came to the United States, he left me pregnant. I waited for him. I respected my relationship.”
Her partner returned nine years later, after living in New York while Clemente had stayed under the command of her mother-in-law, who flung the pots on the floor if the food burned and did not allow her to visit her parents’ home. One day, when Clemente was in the kitchen, she heard her little girl cry out.
“Her father was striking her with a cable,” she recalls. “I didn’t like that. I went to defend my daughter. She was 10 years old. I took my daughter out of his hands, I told him not to hit her. Hit me if you want, but don’t mess with her. Then her grandmother arrived and she told me not to get involved, that she was his daughter. I realized that nothing was going to work with him.”
One morning, her mother-in-law asked her to prepare tortillas for a journey. Clemente asked her who was going on a trip. Her mother-in-law told her that her son was heading back to New York. Clemente was pregnant for the second time. “He never told me or warned me that he would leave, that he was going. He said he was leaving because he didn’t have any money. I told him that money comes and goes, that even if we have to eat tortillas with salt, family is the most important thing. But that, if he wanted to go, he must not be used to being at home anymore. I told him: it’s fine, go for it.”
When Clemente’s youngest child was two years old, her partner ordered her to come to New York. And so, Clemente embarked on the journey, like so many before her, after spending nights crying. Her daughter told her, “Mama, don’t go, what’s going to happen to us? Don’t go.”
Clemente got to New York in 2021. It was the first big city she’d ever visited. She lived in an apartment in the Bronx, where she shared the rent with another woman who was also in a relationship with her partner. Three times, in the apartment, Clemente saw them together. “At first, it made me feel bad. I was sad, disappointed. I cried. It was incredibly hard,” she says. “One day I said, that’s it for us. He didn’t like that.”
One night, her partner arrived home drunk and beat her until she lost consciousness. She missed a week of work as a cleaner for a Jewish family in Brooklyn. “He left too many marks, my face was swollen, he left me with my eyes full of blood. He threatened me and told me that if I went to the police, I would never see my children again. Who wouldn’t be scared?”
On another occasion, her partner threw her against a table and when Clemente told him to stop, he told her to get out of the house, that he didn’t want her, warning her that she’d never see her kids. From Mexico, her mother-in-law escalated their feud: she called Clemente a prostitute and only let her speak to her children on the phone if she sent money every week. She told her that if someone came for her daughter, “she’d give her” to anyone who asked. Clemente worked as much as she could to be able to bring her children over: cleaning floors from 7 a.m. to midnight, working in a salon where they paid her poorly, delivering food. Her daughter asked Clemente to help her leave, seriously this time.
At one point in our conversation, Clemente picks up her mobile phone to check on her son, who is making his way home on the school bus that drops him off very close to their Bronx apartment. The children arrived one year ago, when Clemente met Fabiola Mancilla, the director and founder of the organization Pueblos y Comunidades Indígenas Transfronterizos (Indigenous Cross-Border People and Communities, PUCOMIT), a project that since 2023 has helped reunite children who have been victims of violence. Last year, with the help of the project Al Otro Lado (The Other Side), they were able to accompany 20 minors between the ages of two and 17 to the United States, with the authorization of their parents. By September 2024, they had reunited 25 children who had stayed behind in vulnerable situations.
Mancilla says that all the children who have benefited from her project have “a special condition.” “There are children of activists who were assassinated in Guerrero. Another thing that happens a lot in migrant communities is that the mother and father emigrate. It’s important to note that in Indigenous communities, as romantic a view as academics tend to take of them, when you’re a woman and you marry, you become the property of your husband’s family. In those cases, the minors stay with the spouse’s family and that violence is exercised against them. The children become a way of getting money, because you’re the winner since you’re in the United States, and you’re going to have to give me money for me to set your children free,” she says.
The advocate also helped to bring the children of Raúl Rivera from Guerrero to New York. Rivera is an activist and florist in Bushwick who emigrated 13 years ago to the United States, after falling victim to an armed robbery while working as a taxi driver in Tlapa. After the incident, Rivera said he tried “to live a normal life” in his town, but that proved impossible. He received constant threats. Later, he and his wife decided to make the journey north. Their children, at the time four and seven years old, stayed with their grandmother, their parents promising that they’d come back for them.
“The goal was to get them out of there and give them a better life,” says Rivera. “But my family didn’t want us to bring the kids. My mother said, how could we think about putting them at risk like that, that the border was dangerous. It was an empathic ‘no.’ As long as she was alive, it was impossible to get her to let go of them. In a certain way, I understood.”
When his mother died, his children no longer had anyone to take care of them. “I was so desperate that I thought about going back,” he says. The kids eventually arrived with the help of PUCOMIT and Al Otro Lado in February of 2023, when their parents authorized Mancilla to bring them over. “Migration called me, they asked me for basic information. A social worker was making sure that the kids would be OK, that they would have a bed, food in the refrigerator,” he says. “Seeing them arrive was the best thing that’s ever happened to me, I didn’t think it was possible. I realized they were no longer the little kids I’d left behind, but fortunately I was able to receive them while they still had their innocence. Even though I didn’t have enough time to play with them as I would have liked, it soothes me to know that when I get there in the afternoon, knowing they’re there, that they’re alright.”
Twenty-four-year-old Luz Felipe Narcizo arrived in a similar manner with her nine-year-old brother, who lives with HIV. Despite the fact that the authorities forced his sister to sign documents saying he was receiving his prescriptions, the little boy went three months without his medication. “The doctor told me that it hadn’t arrived, that it was impossible to supply so many people. That happens a lot,” she says. “The boy began to get sick, he was getting a lot of nose bleeds, he was running a high fever.”
After getting into contact with Mancilla, Felipe Narcizo and her brother were turned over to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents. Now they live with their mother in New York. “The boy hasn’t had a nosebleed since we arrived, he hasn’t had a fever,” she says.
Recently, the U.S. government admitted that it had lost track of more than 32,000 underage migrants, but that number could be even higher, given that there are 290,000 children who have yet to receive a date for their court hearing. The situation has been blamed on U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)’s shoddy case monitoring.
“I explain to the mothers, fathers and children how difficult our job is and how careful we have to be,” says Mancilla. “Some people think this is a game, that it’s a tourist visa and it’s not like that. What the parents have to decide is where is best for the child and if it’s worth them making such a traumatic journey. Kids on the border cry, they have to be turned over to a stranger who speaks another language. You have to decide whether it’s best for them to stay in their community. This is not a game.”
“Fabiola helped me so much,” says Clemente. One morning, when her kids were on the way to school in Cuba Libre, their mother ordered the oldest to take a taxi to the city of Tlapa. With the help of some people contacted by Clemente, they arrived at the Mexico City international airport, boarded a plane and traveled up to Tijuana, where they stayed in a shelter until being turned over a few days later to CBP agents. By then, their grandmother had figured out that something had happened to them and activated an amber alert. A lawyer called Clemente and asked about the children.
“I told them that I didn’t know what they were talking about,” says Clemente. “Then in the afternoon, they called me and I told the lawyer that I had every right to be with my children. They told me that if I didn’t turn them in within 24 hours, they were coming for me. That’s when I said yes, come for me.”
Clemente’s children got to the United States at the end of May 2023, after spending a week in custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), which has had a program for unaccompanied minors (UC) since 2003 and has provided services or found sponsors for more than 700,000 children. In the 2023 fiscal year, the program received 118,938 kids, of which 76% were over 14 years old and 61% were boys. They primarily came from Guatemala (42%), Honduras (28%), El Salvador (9%), Mexico (8%) and other countries (13%). As of September 2024, 6,448 children are under the agency’s care, according to data from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).
Once they get out of ORR facilities, the children, who are initially released on parole, can apply after six months for Special Immigrant Juvenile (SIJ) status, a step towards lawful permanent residency.
When Clemente finally had her children with her in New York, she saw how “skinny” her little boy was, that he had fleas and a broken rib. “My kids lived through so much with their grandmother. When they arrived, they had that on their minds. My boy got here and said let’s go, if we don’t go to grandma’s house she’s going to beat us. I grabbed him and said, you’re with me, no one is going to do anything to you because you’re with me. That’s why I brought them here.”
Her oldest daughter is in therapy. Her grandmother kept close tabs on her and wouldn’t even let her visit her other grandmother. “Us women are nothing in Mexico, there’s so much suffering,” says Clemente, who had a baby three months ago with her new partner. “I’m OK, I’m at peace, there’s no one to yell at me, threaten me, beat me or tell me to do this or that. It’s hard when they give you away when you’re young, you have your baby when you’re 12 or 13. We are children at that age. And it’s the women themselves who trample on you. That was what I suffered there at the hands of that woman. Now I want tranquility, peace, and to live happily with my children.”

"https://english.elpais.com/international/2024-09-16/israels-biggest-airline-makes-a-fortune-from-war.html","2024-09-16","Israel’s biggest airline makes a fortune from war","The departure of many foreign airlines has benefited El Al, which raised its prices, angering citizens and triggering an investigation by competition authorities","In a militaristic country reeling from the scale of the Hamas attack, Israel’s flag carrier El Al won the hearts of many Israelis by adding flights — even flying on the Sabbath for the first time since 1982 — to bring in reservists from abroad for the invasion of Gaza and to patrol the Lebanese border. Flying on the Sabbath, El Al argued, was pikuach nefesh, the principle of Jewish law that allows religious rules to be ignored in order to save lives. It was October 2023, all other airlines were cancelling routes to Tel Aviv, and the Israeli parliament was approving $5 billion in war insurance guarantees for the three national airlines (El Al, Arkia and Israir).
There is little left of that collective sympathy. For months, El Al has been the target of criticism on internet forums and in coffee shops for its excessive prices. Most foreign airlines have stopped flying to Tel Aviv (such as Vueling or Iberia, which used to codeshare with El Al), so El Al — the only airline with anti-missile systems on board — exercises a de facto monopoly, watered by public money and without even paying taxes on profits, as it continues to make losses. The State prevented its bankruptcy during the coronavirus crisis.
The main complaint is that, in times of hardship, it received hundreds of millions of dollars, and now it is taking advantage of the situation to make loads of money instead of keeping fares down. In the first months of the war, more than 80% of passengers to and from Tel Aviv flew with El Al. Around 100 foreign airlines cancelled their routes due to the cost of insurance, the safety of the crew and other concerns.
El Al’s prices can be crazy: €1,000 to Madrid; €2,500 to the United States (€11,000 in business class); €4,000 to Mexico… The airline’s corporate results have made waves this year: first-quarter earnings of $80.5 million, compared to the $34.4 million losses in the same period last year. It was the best quarter in its entire history, equivalent to two thirds of the net profit for the whole of 2023, which had already been one of the airline’s best years due to the first months of war.
And then came the second-quarter earnings of $147.4 million, which rubbed even more salt in the wound, especially for Israelis who remain abroad because they are not willing to pay El Al’s fares.
Company sources insist that the anger is fueled by a lack of knowledge of how the pricing system works. “You pay more for the lower price and less for the higher price. If we did not manually set the price, flying to the U.S. would cost $3,000 right now. The benefit comes above all from the fact that the planes are fuller because there is less competition,” they say.
Only El Al currently serves such a popular route as New York-Tel Aviv (80% of the world’s Jews live in Israel or the U.S.). Delta and United Airlines have pulled out for fear of a Hezbollah attack. Ryanair continues to postpone its return. American Airlines will not return until at least April and Easyjet won’t be back before March. Some airlines pulled out in April due to Iran’s first attack on Israel, with more than 300 rockets and drones, and more recently, with Hezbollah’s retaliation, which also canceled flights at Tel Aviv airport.
Shares in El Al, which has just bought 31 Boeing 737 MAXs, have risen 66% so far this year. The surge is also helped by the fact that the local currency, the shekel, has been losing value against the dollar since early 2023, due to Israel’s controversial judicial reform.
The matter has not been limited to angry messages in caps on WhatsApp groups. The Competition Authority is investigating whether the airline is profiting from a monopolistic position. And the Minister of Economy, Nir Barkat, summoned the heads of the three airlines and secured a concession from El Al: fixed prices for four popular destinations: Athens, Larnaca, Dubai and Vienna, although they are not basement bargains either: $350 for a round trip to the Austrian capital. For a source at El Al, intervening in prices is a problem: “We have already booked 70% for December. That prevents those who need it or cannot plan so far in advance from making the trip.”

"https://english.elpais.com/international/2024-09-16/pelicot-and-the-banality-of-evil.html","2024-09-16","Pélicot and the banality of evil","The man who drugged his wife for years so that dozens of men could rape her lived in a quiet village in Provence, a perfectly ordinary setting for scenes of horror. A conviction is a foregone conclusion, but the trial will serve as a laboratory for reflection in France","The regional newspaper La Provence, which covers the area of Vaucluse in southern France, ran a a front page on Thursday with photos of the 50 defendants in the Pélicot trial. The images, with blurred faces, belonged to the men who answered Dominique Pélicot’s invitation, issued for a decade, to come to his house and rape his wife while she was sedated inside their bedroom. Each photograph came with a short biography of each individual in this sort of five-page supplement called “Portraits of the banality of evil.” The statement emulated the famous theory developed by the philosopher Hannah Arendt about the psychological nature of the Nazi Adolf Eichmann, an ordinary guy who was not even anti-Semitic, despite becoming one of the organizers of the Holocaust. And that — the motives that could have led supposedly normal people to commit horror with their actions — is one of the main questions in a case without much mystery as far as the evidence and the conviction are concerned.
The backgrounds of the 50 accused — 18 of whom are in custody — are diverse, both on the personal and professional level: there is a journalist, a construction worker, a nurse, a gardener, a fireman... Their lives, in general, seem ordinary and part of the system, although the years spent in prison have darkened many of them. The trial has underscored the idea that the monster often hides next door. It has also given credence to the idea that most assaults occur in a domestic setting and that the weapons used are simply found inside the home medicine cabinet.
The monster could be any one of us, suggests the defendants’ legal team. So do some of the residents of Mazan, the quiet, pretty little village in the south of France where the couple had retired a decade ago. “Look, this doesn’t represent us. We have nothing to do with these people,” says a waitress inside the main bar, which is close to the car park of the André Malraux school, where Pélicot forced the men who came to his house to park discreetly. Three of the defendants at the trial might be residents of this town. “So what?” the waitress rightly protests.
Mazan and Avignon are separated by a 40-kilometer road that runs through the lush vineyards of Provence, which thousands of tourists visit every year. On the way back to the city, a huge, freshly painted graffiti welcomes visitors: “Hello to those ordinary men capable of horrible crimes,” the message reads. A few kilometers away is the Palace of Justice in Avignon, where the extraordinary case will be tried until December. Given the enormous amount of evidence, the guilty pleas entered by most of the accused and the expected conviction, what will be most relevant about this case is the reflections that emerge and how they will mark France’s relationship with certain concepts concerning sexual matters such as consent, submission or sexual education.
Beatrice Zavarro, a lawyer with experience defending sexual offenders, walks out the courthouse hours before the trial, with the papers under her arm and her robe still on. Dark-skinned, petite and wearing burgundy-coloured glasses like a tiara, she has become one of the most iconic characters in the trial taking place these days in Avignon. She represents the main defendant, Dominique Pélicot. Her role, of enormous moral and emotional complexity, is fundamental in a trial that is already lost. She accepted the case because she found it “very interesting on a human and personality level.”
Zavarro’s idea — or at least her opinion of the accused — is that it is useless to evoke the “banality of evil” because that is a moral concept. “Morality is not justice. And we are not here to judge moral questions, but facts, criminal offenses. And in any case, it is not a question of the banality of evil. Otherwise, this man would have other convictions on his record. And he only has one in 2010, when he filmed upskirts,” she has said. This is not entirely accurate, because although he has not yet been charged, Pélicot’s DNA implicates him in two other rapes that the judge is now investigating. Two female real estate agents — the same profession as himself — who were raped after being put to sleep with ether.
The idea that Zavarro defends makes Pélicot, the alleged mastermind of more than 50 rapes, a mirror of society. “We are all capable of doing horrible things,” says the lawyer. “There are no predictions for what an individual can or cannot commit. We see it with children too. There can be behaviors that are not a reflection of our personality.” Zavarro explains that she does not expect anything concrete from the sentence, because she and her client know that he will be convicted. “I am going to try to send a message that the man I am defending is not a monster. What he has done is monstrous, that is unquestionable, and I am not going to minimize his responsibility. I am simply saying that you can do something monstrous without being a monster. He built a family, he had a wife whom he loved and she loved him, he had three children who each have a position in life. His life was normal and everyday. And besides that, there was a darker side, a side in the shadows, for which he is now sitting in the dock.”
Gisèle Pélicot’s lawyers, as well as the victim herself and her family, know that the outcome of the trial is largely a foregone conclusion. “My clients only hope to gain a better understanding of who this man was who raised them, or with whom they shared their life for 50 years, because one day they discovered that they did not know him at all. They want to know who the man was with whom they shared their holidays, who raised them, who took them to school… For his children, now in their forties, it is important to know, because the backbone of their life has collapsed and they need to understand many things,” says lawyer Antoine Camus.
For the lawyer, there are still many gaps in the case. “Did all this start in 2011, when the police discovered it, or had he been doing it for years? Was he only using Temesta to drug her? Was he putting his wife in danger of death by giving her 10 2.5 milligram pills that could have killed her? The reality of the facts is that they no longer expect anything more than that, because they have already understood that Pélicot was duplicity in the flesh.”
Psychiatrists attribute Pélicot’s behavior to a so-called cleavage rather than to the caricature of the monster or the moral idea of evil. This is a self-defense phenomenon that develops in the first years of life to protect oneself from a strong anxiety generated by the distortion between the image that we would like to project to others and what we really are. “And this mechanism of self-protection explains why this man had an A side and a B side. And why he only showed his family the A side, including his wife, whom he had to put to sleep so that she wouldn’t see it. It would have been much easier for the family if this man had been a bad father, if he had hit his children, or had been a disinterested husband… But no, he was a great father, a wonderful neighbor and his wife adored him. They all fell from a 36th floor.”
Gisèle Pélicot — who still keeps the surname she adopted when she married Dominique — has become a symbol of the feminist struggle in recent weeks. Her face appears in hundreds of photomontages of activism against sexual abuse. This Saturday, various marches are being called across the country in support of the victim, who decided to make the trial public so that the press could have access to all the testimonies. “This case will be a turning point,” Elsa Labouret, spokesperson for the association Osez le feminisme, told this newspaper. Her lawyer clarifies the issue and points out that she is not seeking to turn this trial into “a trial against men, or about the toxicity of male sexuality.” “It is not at all what she is saying. She cannot prevent anyone from thinking what they will. But she is not trying to turn this into a confrontation between the sexes; on the contrary, she wants this to be a dialogue and to show the reality of what rape is in all its crudeness. It is not a confrontation, it is a conversation.”
Meanwhile, Dominique Pélicot was again reported ill on Monday. After suspending his testimony last week, on Monday he was said to be suffering from gallstone and a kidney infection, and it was unlikely that he would be appearing in court as scheduled.

"https://english.elpais.com/international/2024-09-16/ukraine-loses-confidence-in-zelenskiys-newscast.html","2024-09-16","Ukraine loses confidence in Zelenskiy’s newscast","Polls, international organizations and Ukrainian journalists are all criticizing ‘United News,’ the merger of various Ukrainian television channels to broadcast 24-hour news controlled by the government","To understand what the so-called telethon in Ukraine, branded as Yedyni Novyny or United News, it’s best to imagine a 24-hour news program — one that’s supervised by the government.
This has been happening in Ukraine since February 2022, when the Russian invasion began. The Ukrainian presidency announced — due to the exceptional nature of the situation — the creation of a unified news program that covers most of the daily events and is broadcast by both public and privately-owned channels. Media groups that rejected the order to participate in this lost the option of having a broadcasting license and being able to operate on cable or internet platforms. However, two-and-a-half years later, citizens are turning their backs on United News, considering it to be a propaganda tool.
The principal Ukrainian polling groups that regularly ask the population about the program have found that, with each passing month, the credibility of the project is diminishing. On September 9, the latest survey by the Razumkov Center on this issue was published: 51% of respondents felt that the telethon is no longer relevant as a source of information, compared to 17% who think it is. The rest of those polled responded “don’t know,” or refused to select an option.
Andriana Kucher is an anchor for Channel 24, a television channel that’s not part of the telethon. Channel 24′s news programs are broadcast online: it’s the audiovisual medium with the most followers on YouTube in Ukraine (7.6 million subscribers). Channels that aren’t included in the telethon’s programming aren’t permitted to broadcast on digital terrestrial television. The most notorious cases were that of Channel 5 — owned by former president and businessman Petro Poroshenko — and Espreso TV. Both media outlets are critical of the head of state, Volodymyr Zelenskiy.
“The telethon made sense in the early stages of the war, because the situation was chaotic and it provided security. But, just three months later, it became something negative, propaganda,” Kucher notes. “It has no in-depth reporting, nor diversity of opinions, which is why I hardly watch it.”
“The key problem with United News is that it’s lost credibility, because it’s become propaganda that avoids reporting on the government’s mistakes,” says Petro Burkovskyi, director of the Ilko Kucheriv Democratic Initiatives Foundation. ”In and of itself, it’s neither good nor bad… it’s just another tool during [a time of] war. But the public considers it to be an instrument in the wrong hands, often put to negative use.”
Burkovskyi — like Kucher — stresses that the TV program was a useful tool at the beginning of the invasion to counter Russian disinformation that wanted to destabilize the Ukrainian population, by convincing them that the army wasn’t fighting and that the government had fled. Based on data from another survey from 2024, Burkovskyi notes that currently only 36% of Ukrainians use United News as their main source of information. To reverse the situation, the head of the Democratic Initiatives Foundation believes that it’s time for control of its programming to be transferred to professionals from Suspilne, the state-owned television and radio corporation.
The editorial staff of the news networks participating in United News are each responsible for different broadcast slots. The plurality of opinions is slightly greater when the news is produced by public television. This was confirmed by a study published this past April by the Center for Media Plurality and Freedom, an agency of the Robert Schuman Center of the EU. The author of the document — Dariia Opryschko — pointed out that while public media outlets are obliged to give voice to opposition parties, on private channels, no critical voices are invited. Opryschko emphasizes that journalistic standards are frequently violated in United News.
The content is decided in meetings between representatives of the networks. However, there is direct intervention and supervision by the president’s office. This has been revealed by several examples put together by journalist Simon Shuster in The Showman (2024), one of the most notable books published to-date on Zelenskiy’s management of the war. Shuster was able to live with the president and his team during the first year of the invasion. “Nothing of the sort had existed in Ukraine since the Soviet era, and critics complained that it smacked of wartime propaganda,” the author writes.
The European Commission — in a document from November 2023 — warned that, on Ukraine’s path to EU membership, it is essential to address the lack of plurality on television: “Ukraine needs to envisage new ways to ensure a post-war structure for pluralistic and independent non-online media (in particular television), including the long-term outlook of the public broadcaster and independence of the national regulator.”
More severe was the report by the U.S. State Department on the human rights situation in Ukraine, published in April 2023: “President ZelenskIy signed a decree imposing martial law in February 2022 following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which permitted further restrictions on the media and media freedoms. For example, the national TV Marathon [United News] — a rotating platform of channels that take the government line on war reporting — enabled an unprecedented level of control over primetime television news.”
The U.S. government analysis includes a recurring warning from human rights and journalistic institutions in Ukraine: “The government banned, blocked, or sanctioned media outlets and individual journalists deemed a threat to national security or who expressed positions authorities believed undermined the country’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.”
Opryshko stresses that media pluralism in Ukraine has declined, but the situation is better for traditional newspapers, online media platforms and radio stations. The problem, she says, is in television. Three channels lost their broadcasting licenses “without ground,” just for being against the unified newscast. This expert says that the telethon is one of the reasons why “people massively move to social media platforms in search of news,” especially to anonymous news channels on Telegram. The Ukrainian authorities have been warning for a year about the dangers posed by the use of this application among soldiers (it’s the most common communication system between troops), but also about the access that Ukrainian citizens have to pro-Russian information channels.
The president’s office has insisted that United News is indeed a reliable source of news in the face of Russian disinformation. This is what newly-appointed Minister of Culture Mykola Tochytksyi has also argued. On September 6, in the Verkhovna Rada — the Ukrainian parliament — the minister said that it was essential to maintain the broadcast, “because it’s important that there’s a single voice that tells [the Ukrainian population] what’s happening.” The minister did concede that it’s necessary to reform the program, so as to “find a way to make it interesting for the public.”

"https://english.elpais.com/international/2024-09-16/kate-middletons-controversial-strategy-to-control-her-cancer-story.html","2024-09-16","Kate Middleton’s controversial strategy to control her cancer story","The video revealing the end of the Princess of Wales’ chemotherapy treatment moved some in the U.K. while irritating others","Kate Middleton’s video announcing that she had finally finished her chemotherapy treatment has been greeted with relief and joy by all those who see her as the royal family’s greatest asset and hope for its future. But the video has also triggered controversy. Put together by filmmaker and wedding specialist Will Warr, the footage has led many to wonder whether the Prince and Princess of Wales are embarking on a new strategy to communicate directly with the public, cutting out the media.
“I can’t imagine the King doing such a thing,” said senior royal affairs journalist Robert Jobson, author of the biography Catherine. The Princess of Wales. “It was slightly incongruous, and some parts of the text didn’t quite convince me, but overall, I think it was a good thing. The video moved many who saw it, it’s true, but is this the way the monarchy should do things?”
When the British royal family experiments with opening up to the public and exposing their private lives, there is invariably a divided reaction. Some are uncomfortable with an overly touchy-feely approach, while others see it as justifying their existence.
According to The Times columnist James Marriot, we are so used to feeding on the intimate details of celebrities’ lives that any demand for privacy is considered an affront. Marriot is among those who believe that Middleton has fallen into the trap of making a sad concession to an insatiably hungry public.
Although it was Kate who decided when and how she would reveal the end of her treatment, the video is a way of admitting that her private life is now everyone’s property. If there was a time when Prince William lashed out angrily at any photographer who tried to steal a snapshot of his children, the three-minute film that Kensington Palace posted on social networks offers an intimate look at their lives, controlled but inconceivable until now.
In it, William and Catherine hang out, hold hands, kiss, laugh. They play with their children and are shown as an idyllic family facing misfortune and recovery together.
In 1969, Queen Elizabeth II allowed the BBC cameras into her family’s life to film a documentary simply titled Royal Family. It was the brainchild of William Heseltine, then press secretary at Buckingham Palace, who wanted to humanize the Windsors for a public that considered them haughty and aloof. A total of 37 million people saw the footage. Rumor has it — as suggested in the Netflix series The Crown — that the late queen immediately regretted the decision and ordered the BBC to archive the footage and not broadcast it again.
Others, such as the late queen’s biographer, Robert Hardman, say this was not so. He claims that the palace was delighted with the documentary’s impact but wanted to retain control of a product that was more family album than public property.
But in the age of social media, it is difficult to put the genie back in the bottle once it is out.
“The Princess of Wales’ video feels like an attempt to meet social media on its own terms. Social media is, of course, the arena in which hunting Kate became a jolly global blood sport earlier this year, when — despite having been explicitly told that she would not appear in public before Easter owing to significant illness — the #BeKind brigade grew bored within weeks and whipped up a vicious feeding frenzy of conspiracy theories as to her absence and the reasons for it,” columnist Marina Hyde wrote in The Guardian.
Despite growing up in a wealthy, upper-middle-class family, Kate Middleton comes from a more prosaic background than her husband, Prince William.
“She went to private schools, and her parents always gave her the best, but she understands what an ordinary life is. And I think that’s important as we enter a world where new generations are questioning the idea of a hereditary monarchy,” Jobson says. “In a matter of 20 years, it will be challenged in places like Australia, Canada and New Zealand [where the British monarch is still the symbolic head of state], and Kate’s input will be very important in advising William.”
The Princess of Wales is the most appreciated royal figure in the U.K. According to the YouGov poll, which is regularly updated, her popularity is 71%. That of her husband, William, 69%. That of the King, Charles III, 56%.
Middleton’s illness came at a time when her popularity was stratospheric. She occupied all the front pages and was being lauded by both the British and international media. The two months that she absented herself from public life to recover from an abdominal surgery, unleashed endless rumors and conspiracy theories about where she was and the state of her health.
The sobriety with which she resurfaced in a video confirming her cancer diagnosis on March 22 contrasts sharply with this later production, which comes complete with slow motion, filters, music and rehearsed scenes.
The royalists who are unconvinced by this recent release argue that the Princess of Wales has surrendered to the voracity of a certain public and has wrongly believed that the only way to satiate their curiosity is with a saccharine version of a painful, personal reality, which any fight against cancer must surely be.

She gets in her car to start the day, while her daughter stays home. For the past week, she hasn’t wanted to take her little girl to school.
“I feel more at ease leaving her locked up with the neighbor, instead of having to take her across Culiacán. But I go to work wanting to cry, not because of what might happen to me, but because I don’t know if I’ll see her again,” she tells EL PAÍS, on the condition that her real name not be published. “But I don’t cry,” the civil servant clarifies. “We work for the government and they haven’t given us permission to miss work. The life insurance they give me is worth less than 100,000 pesos [$5,000]. I keep thinking about what I’m going to leave her… what I’m going to leave my daughter. You don’t feel protected or supported. You literally feel nothing,” she laments, on the other end of the phone.
The Mexican state of Sinaloa has been plagued by violence and insecurity since Monday, September 9, when an internal war broke out between the two most powerful factions of the notorious cartel: the followers of Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada, versus Los Chapitos, the sons of Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán. The fracture has sown chaos in Culiacán — the capital of the state in the northwest of Mexico — and in several surrounding communities, leaving a trail of murders, forced disappearances, blockades by drug traffickers and clashes between criminal groups and the Armed Forces. Caught in the crossfire, the population has sunk into fear and uncertainty, despite the government’s insistence that “everything is calm” and under control.
Last week, the authorities acknowledged that at least 12 people have been killed, another dozen have been injured by bullets, while around 20 have disappeared. Still, they maintain that the violence is concentrated in certain areas and mainly affects factions fighting over the principal bastion of the Sinaloa Cartel.
“They’re abducting innocent people,” says María, a psychologist who lives in the north of Culiacán, one of the hot spots for drug violence. Last Monday, she notes, one of her acquaintances disappeared without a trace. His car was abandoned on one of the city streets. “They mistook him for someone else and grabbed him,” she say. “He was missing for more than 20 hours, but at night, they told me they had found him… that he was scared, but fine.” María affirms that she has recognized other people in the missing persons reports that have been released over the past week. “There are many people who haven’t appeared and who haven’t returned. We don’t know if they’ll come back,” she adds.
Violence has disrupted the lives of the inhabitants of Culiacán. Most people are afraid to go out to work, take their children to school, or buy something in a store. “It’s as if we’ve returned to the pandemic: from 7 p.m. onwards, you’ll find the main streets emptier. It’s become an informal curfew,” María says. “There’s a collective psychosis: anxiety attacks, insomnia, stress, a fairly strong sense of fear... we weren’t prepared for this.”
Many families turn to their phones to report where they are and what they’re going to do, as well as to share information about what has happened in the last few hours. On social media, criticisms of the government, explicit images of crimes and reports of new clashes and blockades — some real and others false — are multiplying. At the beginning of the week, official information was scarce, or downplayed the extent of insecurity. All of this was exploited by the drug traffickers, who capitalize on the fear that they instill in the population.
“The authorities are on the back foot; the ones who set the tone are the criminal groups,” says David Saucedo, a security analyst, in an interview with EL PAÍS. President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has acknowledged that the violence broke out because “there are fights between two groups,” but he also accused the media of “magnifying” the situation for the sake of “sensationalism.”
“Tell the people of Culiacán, of Sinaloa, that we have enough [of a security] presence to guarantee peace [and] tranquility,” the president affirmed.
Culiacán is no stranger to violence. “Everything is tainted by drug trafficking in Sinaloa,” said Ana Luz Ruelas — professor emeritus at the Autonomous University of Sinaloa — in a conversation with EL PAÍS last month. Despite the normalization and permanent reach of organized crime, some episodes of violence have remained etched in the collective imagination. The Sinaloa Cartel rained fire in early-2023, following the capture of Ovidio Guzmán, son of El Chapo. “El Ratón” (“the mouse”) — as the 34-year-old capo is known — had already been arrested in 2019. But a violent response from the cartel — which included prison riots, illicit checkpoints on major highways and murders — led the authorities to decide to let him go, so as to avoid further damage.
The latest war to ravage the state emerged following the unexpected capture of El Mayo and Joaquín Guzmán López — Ovidio’s older brother, otherwise known as “El Güero” — on July 25, in the United States. Zambada accused El Güero — his godson — of betraying him, ambushing him and handing him over to the U.S. authorities, after summoning him to a meeting with Governor Rubén Rocha and political leader Héctor Cuén. Cuén was killed that same day. Rocha has denied having been present.
After that, fears soared regarding El Mayo’s revenge: when it would come and whether it would involve another Culiacanazo, the word used to describe the outbreaks of violence that followed the two captures of Ovidio Guzmán.
“It’s been worse before, [but] it’s never lasted so long,” explains Karla, a resident of the municipality of Costa Rica, south of Culiacán. On the morning of Monday, September 9, a confrontation on the main access road to that community resulted in two injured civilians and 15 bullet-ridden vehicles. On Tuesday night, the body of a decomposing person was found on the side of a road. On Wednesday, there was another scuffle between the security forces and “armed civilians,” the description used by the authorities to subtly refer to the cartels. On Thursday, the suspension of school activities in four municipalities — Culiacán, Elota, Cosalá and San Ignacio — was decreed for the rest of the week. “The narrative of the state authorities declares ‘tranquility’ and minimizes the violent events. They don’t understand that, after the capture of El Mayo, the entire context of Sinaloa changed: people have been waiting for the ‘war’ since then,” Adrián López, director of the newspaper Noroeste, posted on social media.
“Four hours ago, I went out to buy tortillas at a store that’s half-a-mile from my house. When I turned the first corner, I saw three patrol cars. I didn’t know if they were cloned by the criminals, or actually belonged to the police. I froze: I didn’t know what to do or where to go,” Karla recalls, in an interview with EL PAÍS. “The sound of the bullets makes your skin crawl… some were bursts, others were intermittent. It was chaos. I’ve heard gunshots before, but not on this scale,” she adds. “What we’re experiencing is like a horror movie.”
Karla understands both sides of the interruption of school activities: she’s a teacher and a mother. Like Yazmín, she’s decided that her daughter should stay home. The local Education Department has been the target of criticism from teachers and parents, first ordering the suspension of classes in one of the city’s sectors, then announcing a broader cancellation with little notice. After initially pushing for a return to in-person classes, the department finally resigned itself to postponing classes for another week.
The Autonomous University of Sinaloa — which has 70,000 students throughout the state — has opted for virtual classes. Still, problems persist. “Many students come from rural areas and don’t have internet access. Others don’t have credit on their phones, because their families haven’t been able to go out to work,” Karla explains. “We cannot demand that they go look for an internet cafe to send in their assignments… we cannot expose them to any risk.”
Governor Rocha asked retailers to open their businesses, after the local branch of the National Chamber of Commerce warned that there were no minimum security conditions to avoid the paralysis of the local economy. The Union of Retailers of Culiacán estimates that the economic losses due to violence are over 800 million pesos ($40 million), while warning about a shortage of basic products. The local Union of Tenants estimates that 2,000 workers have resigned due to the violence, just in the center of the city.
Oxxo — the largest chain of convenience stores in Mexico and Latin America — announced that it was going to take extreme measures to guarantee the safety of its employees and hoped that “security conditions in the state would be restored to resume normal operations.” Aeromexico announced a flexible policy to change flight schedules and routes to and from Culiacán. Coparmex — the country’s main employers’ association — denounced the lack of action by the authorities and demanded greater security guarantees amid the violence. The governor opted to cancel a concert in the city’s main public square for the celebrations of Independence Day, on September 16. And the United States issued a travel alert, warning citizens not to visit the state. Those who do so are advised to “be aware of [their] surroundings” and “maintain a high level of vigilance and keep a low profile.”
After El Chapo’s extradition to the United States in 2017 and his life sentence being handed down in 2019, four of his sons stepped up in the business. Los Chapitos undertook an aggressive expansion strategy and moved away from the discreet style of other factions, such as the one led by El Mayo. Zambada made few public appearances in recent years, although, before his capture, he imposed — with an iron fist — a strict criminal governance in his territories, stretching out a wide network of corruption that allowed him to avoid jail for five decades. Guzmán’s heirs are considered to be a much more impulsive group, prone to public displays of power and ostentation.
According to U.S. authorities, the Mayiza and the Chapiza — as both groups are known — have been at odds for years, but they coexisted under the same umbrella in the understanding that they were stronger together. “For more than 50 years, [the relationship] has been impeccable, respectful and harmonious, to the point that there are [guardianships] and marriages between both families,” said José Luis Rodríguez Meza — El Chapo’s lawyer — at the end of July.
The capture of El Mayo changed everything. Amid the tensions and despite Zambada’s calls for calm from prison, a dozen members of the Mayiza were killed in the weeks before hostilities intensified. Mausoleums of other bosses were desecrated and there were shootouts between “armed civilians” and the authorities. Security analysts, however, estimate that the firepower and presence of Zambada’s group had been declining since before his arrest, compared to the better-armed and more powerful Los Chapitos. One of the hypotheses explaining the delayed outbreak of violence is that Ismael Zambada Sicairos — alias “Mayito Flaco,” the supposed successor to his father — postponed revenge to have time to arm himself and seal strategic alliances.
A source linked to the Mayiza assured the CrashOut Media website that Mayito Flaco created a “war council” at the beginning of September with two new partners: José Gil Caro Quintero — nephew of the notorious Rafael Caro Quintero — and Isidro Meza Flores. Both are old enemies of El Chapo. According to this version, Flores’ people agreed to send 200 hitmen and Caro Quintero offered another 150 to “fumigate Los Chapitos.”
Today, the focus isn’t only on Sinaloa. The outbreaks of violence have spread to other states. Local populations are on tenterhooks to see how the Jalisco Nueva Generación Cartel (CJNG) — the main rival of the Sinaloa Cartel — will move its pieces. Another possibility is that Los Chapitos will go on the offensive and seek to wipe out their adversaries, in order to take control of the entire criminal organization. There are also pending trials: El Chapo fell after the testimony in court of Jesús “Rey” Zambada and Vicente “Vicentillo” Zambada — brother and son of El Mayo — as well as other former collaborators.
The authorities have acknowledged that the conflict exists and will continue, but haven’t given public explanations about it. “It’s a matter [to be resolved between the cartels]... [they must ensure] that they don’t affect the population and that they also take care of themselves,” President López Obrador declared on Friday. He trusts that the arrival of hundreds of reinforcements from the Armed Forces will quell the violence. But the “matter” affects everyone.
“Even if you don’t want to find out or don’t know much about the Mayiza or the Chapiza, it’s what everyone is talking about. We’re all thinking about what tomorrow will bring and when we’ll be able to have a normal life,” María laments. “The days have become eternal and the nights are super short. Suddenly, you open your eyes and it’s daylight again… and you don’t know what’s going to happen.”
Yazmín looks in the rearview mirror and side mirrors, speeding up to get to work faster. She trembles whenever a truck stops next to her. “You start to see shootings, missing people, dead people. And, suddenly, the government tells you that nothing’s happening. We all knew that the atmosphere was tense, that at some point the war was going to happen.”
While the crossfire besieges Sinaloa, the United States has announced the transfer of El Mayo to the Eastern District Court of New York, the same one where El Chapo — his former ally — was convicted five years ago.

"https://english.elpais.com/international/2024-09-16/map-how-germanys-border-closures-jeopardize-the-schengen-area.html","2024-09-16","Map | How Germany’s border closures jeopardize the Schengen Area","The announcement by Olaf Scholz’s government, which comes into force on Monday, is a blow to free movement in the EU, which has seen previous threats such as the refugee crisis in 2015 and the Covid pandemic","The great pillar of European architecture — the free movement of people and goods in the Schengen Area — is on shaky ground. Member states have been tightening border controls with increasing frequency, and the Schengen Area is now marked by scar-like dividing lines. Germany’s decision to install controls on its nine borders starting Monday is another blow that has angered neighbors and alarmed experts who fear that one of the EU’s greatest achievements could collapse.
According to Alberto Alemanno, Jean Monnet Professor of European Law and Policies at the Paris School of Business Studies, the German announcement is unprecedented “in terms of its scale and nature.” The expert, who talks to EL PAÍS by phone from the United States, argues that the measure from the Olaf Scholz government is “incompatible with EU law,” and more motivated by politics than strategy. Faced with the rise of the far right, the German government has justified the measure — initially planned for six months — by claiming it is in response to migratory pressure and the risk of Islamist terrorism.
The reintroduction of border controls is intended as an exception in the event of a threat to public order or national security. It should be a last resort and must be justified and proportionate. Alemanno believes that Germany’s reasons do not meet these requirements. The expert also stresses that, since the controls will be applied across all of Germany’s borders — and Germany is at the heart of the EU and its largest economy — the move will not only on neighboring states, but “virtually all of them.”
The first to react to Berlin’s announcement were the countries that share a border with Germany. Poland’s liberal-conservative prime minister, Donald Tusk, described the order as a “de facto suspension of the Schengen Agreement on a large scale,” and announced that he would begin “urgent consultations” with the other eight countries directly affected. Austria said it would not accept people whom Germany decided to turn away at its border, and the Netherlands warned of the impact on cross-border workers. According to EU data, 1.7 million people cross intra-EU borders every day to work in another country.
Berlin’s decision has consequences that reach far beyond its territory. For Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, the German government is seeking to “unilaterally abolish Schengen.” His Hungarian counterpart, the populist Viktor Orbán — who supports anti-immigration policies — welcomed Scholz into the “club” of the EU countries who want border controls.
Schengen came into force in 1995 and now covers 29 states, 25 of the 27 that make up the EU (Ireland and Cyprus are excluded, while Romania and Bulgaria are partially integrated), plus Norway, Switzerland, Iceland and Liechtenstein. The area of free movement has so far been compromised by two major crises. The first was the arrival of more than a million asylum seekers, largely fleeing the war in Syria, in 2015 and 2016. The second was the Covid-19 pandemic.
In recent years, several states have reinstated or strengthened controls and have gradually extended what was initially a temporary measure. These measures have been defended as a response to migratory pressure, as well as the threat of terrorism, which is how countries such as France have been justifying restrictions in force since 2015. Other states have also recently cited the wars in Ukraine and Gaza — and the associated risks of Russian operations, an increase in refugees or terrorist attacks — as reasons to strengthen border control.
In the autumn of 2023, the increase in migrant arrivals via the Balkan route prompted a chain of border closures to cut off their passage. Slovakia with Hungary; Poland with Slovakia; Germany with Poland, the Czech Republic and Switzerland... Some border closures are still in place, such as those imposed by Berlin, which are now being extended. Austria — which Germany has implemented controls on since 2015 — has also established restrictions on the border with Slovakia and the Czech Republic that expire on October 15, and with Slovenia and Hungary, in force until November 11. The country has argued that its asylum system is under pressure, and also pointed to security reasons exacerbated by the conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza.
Slovenia has controls with Croatia and Hungary until December 21. In its notification to the European Commission, which has no veto power, it cited deteriorating global security, as well as the increased terrorist threat and organized crime in the Western Balkans. The country also cited sporting events such as the European Championship and the Olympic Games, among other reasons specified by some countries.
Italy has also stepped up security on its border with Slovenia, which will remain in place until December. It justified this move by pointing to the threat of terrorists hiding among migrants on the Balkan route, risks related to the war in Ukraine and the danger of outbreaks of violence linked to Italy’s presidency of the G7.
Denmark is monitoring land and sea traffic with Germany, citing terrorist threats related to the Gaza war, Koran burnings in 2023 and the risk of Russian espionage. Sweden has also stepped up its checks, saying the Gaza war poses a security threat, including antisemitic attacks.
Norway, which is not a member of the EU but is part of the Schengen Area, has imposed controls on ports with ferry connections that are in force until November 11. Oslo also fears Russian operations that could jeopardize its gas exports or its military aid to Ukraine.
Restrictions by member states often come up against criticism from the European Parliament, which approved an update of the Schengen Borders Code, in force since June. The reform aims to improve coordination between member states in the face of shared threats, and to ensure the closure or reinforcement of border crossings is only taken in truly exceptional cases. The Commission has recommended that the 27 EU states use alternative measures such as police checks and joint patrols between states to avoid the closure of internal borders. The aim is to reinforce and protect the free movement of goods and people. “This is the most tangible benefit of the EU,” stresses Alemanno, who describes Germany’s decision as “a nail in the coffin of Schengen.”

Meanwhile, fear, violence and mental health issues grow in the face of international paralysis","“I am very tired and have no energy for anything.” Nahid’s soft, self-conscious voice comes from Mazar-i-Sharif in northern Afghanistan. Nahid is 25, and her name is not Nahid. It is becoming increasingly difficult for Afghan women to trust someone they don’t know to describe their daily life under the Taliban regime. In August 2021, this young woman was working as a hairdresser, but she had to quit after a few weeks to avoid being beaten or arrested by the fundamentalists. “The days go by and nothing changes. I have less and less contact with my friends and now, with these new rules, we are going to be even more isolated. I am even afraid to meet them at a house to talk. I have lost hope of regaining a normal life,” she tells EL PAÍS by phone.
Nahid is referring to the latest edict issued by the fundamentalists, at the end of August, which further oppresses women by banning them from speaking in public, from their faces being seen outside the home, from looking into the eyes of a man who is not a family member, or from leaving the house without a male chaperone.
NGOs, activists, and Afghan women, inside and outside the country, describe these measures as “the final nail in the coffin of women.” Since their return to power on 15 August, 2021, the Taliban have issued more than 100 edicts that have gradually erased the presence of women from the public space. They have closed the doors to education for women aged over 12, an unprecedented restriction in the world, and excluded them from most jobs and places of leisure. They have also severely restricted their movements and their right to receive healthcare and legal assistance.
“Being a woman in Afghanistan today means that you cannot take a cab without a male escort, or that you cannot speak normally to the shopkeeper who sells you food. And if you are a widow, for example, and you have no children or brothers, what do you do? Women are living like criminals, they are deprived of the minimum dignity that human beings deserve,” Fawzia Koofi, a former Afghan parliamentarian who participated in peace talks with the Taliban before 2021, says by phone from the United States.
Mariam Safi, director of the Development Research and Policy Studies Organisation (DROPS), which conducts surveys and research on human rights in Afghanistan through a network of local collaborators, recalls that this is the first time that these rules — applied in practice by the Taliban since their first period in government (1996-2001) — have been written down in law. “It seems that these new rules have surprised the international community. Not us. We knew that the Taliban would not back down and that we had to be very firm with them. But the United Nations chose to bring them to the negotiating table to speak directly with them about the situation of women. It is clear that it did not work,” she explains to this newspaper in a telephone conversation from Toronto.
When they returned to Kabul in 2021, following the withdrawal of foreign troops from the country, the Taliban guaranteed that fundamental freedoms would be respected and said they needed time to create safe environments for women to study and work. The international community wanted to believe them. “But they have been in power for three years, it doesn’t seem likely they are going to leave, and they have not kept their word. Countries that do not officially recognize the Taliban as a government, but do have dealings with them, could demand a timetable. For example: ‘You said you would open secondary schools, so give us a date. You promised to cancel that measure in the medium term, so tell us when that will happen,’” suggests Dorothy Estrada Tanck, who is part of the UN Working Group on discrimination against women and girls.
The Working Group and Richard Bennett, the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Afghanistan, co-authored the report presented to the Human Rights Council in 2023, in which they concluded that the Taliban regime has established gender apartheid and the persecution of women. In June, Bennett again recommended that this be recognized as a crime against humanity. Last week, the Taliban banned the UN representative from entering Afghanistan. “Recognizing gender apartheid as a crime against humanity would pave the way for accountability both from Afghanistan as a state, and from specific individuals in the country,” stresses Estrada Tanck.
Following the publication of the new Taliban edict, a group of Spanish women is collecting signatures to urge the government to go to the International Criminal Court to declare the treatment of Afghan women a crime against humanity. In addition, on September 5, Spanish Socialist MEPs called on the European Union to denounce the latest decisions of the Taliban before international justice, and to clarify the bloc’s role in providing international protection for Afghan women who flee and reach Europe.
“We need to think about who is silencing these women’s voices. We are all doing it, because we are not paying attention to them, even though there is no comparable situation in the world,” says María López de la Usada, vice president of Netwomening, one of the organizations that supports the social integration of Afghan women in Spain.
Hussnia Bakhtiyari, an Afghan prosecutor who has been living in Spain for almost two years, panicked when she called her family in Kabul and, on the other side of the screen, her 18-year-old sister appeared with a black eye. “She didn’t want to tell me what had happened to her, but she ended up telling me that a Taliban hit her in the street because he thought her dress was too short. It reached her ankles, but apparently it wasn’t enough.” Bakhtiyari doesn’t sleep thinking about her two sisters, who remain in Afghanistan.
“What rights do Afghan women have under this new law? Virtually none. Wasn’t it enough that we weren’t allowed to go to university, to our offices, to the hairdresser? But nobody does anything, nobody says anything,” says the 35-year-old, who was part of a group of prosecutors, judges, and lawyers evacuated and welcomed by Spain in January 2023.
DROPS and other NGOs have warned that one of the side effects of women not being able to work or study is forced and child marriages, of girls aged 12 and 13. In addition, fear, lack of future prospects, and poverty dangerously undermine their mental health. Many women live locked up in themselves, barely saying a word. Others suffer from deep depression in total solitude and some resort, in desperation, to taking their own lives. In 2023, DROPS interviewed 2,000 women in 17 Afghan provinces about the psychological damage caused by fundamentalist rules: 68% of those surveyed said they knew a woman in their environment with mental health issues. But mental health remains a taboo subject in a country where going to a psychologist was never well-regarded, and is now impossible for a young woman. “Families hush up problems, cover up suicides,” says Bakhtiyari.
Because homes are not a safe place for Afghan women either, NGOs working in the country have detected an increase in violence against women within families, and a general lack of understanding regarding the restriction of their rights. “We have spoken to women in several provinces in recent days, and we feel that they are increasingly afraid. This edict will undoubtedly deepen their psychological problems. They will think twice before leaving home or going to work in the only two sectors where their presence was still tolerated: health and child education. Will their male escort have to speak for them at school, or in the hospital?” asks Safi.
Razea is one of many Afghan women in Islamabad, the capital of Pakistan, waiting for a country to grant them international protection. These women live in hiding, with hardly any resources, and in fear of being deported. “What did I flee from? In Kandahar, my city, a Taliban can knock on your door at night, rape you, take you by force and marry you. The anguish is hard to imagine. My friends who are still there call me every day, crying” explains the 31-year-old over the phone. She escaped from her country clandestinely by road with her brother more than a year ago and also does not want her real name to be published.
According to the UN, there are around 7.7 million Afghan refugees in Iran and Pakistan, of whom at least 1.6 million arrived after August 2021. The ordeal for women does not end when they leave the country. Organizations supporting Afghan women, such as Netwomening and Afghan Women on the Run, explain that there are women who requested an appointment at the Spanish embassy in Islamabad in 2021 to request asylum, received a number indicating their place in the queue, and are still waiting to be called for a first interview. Between August 2021 and August 2022, that is, in the first year after the return of the Taliban, Spain evacuated 3,900 people from Afghanistan, according to official figures. Since then, they have been arriving in dribs and drabs.
These NGOs help women prepare their request for protection from diplomatic authorities and there are cases that particularly shock them, such as that of a journalist who was refused transfer to Spain because it was decided that she was not in danger. “We have presented an appeal to the embassy itself and we have taken the case to the High Court. We believe that they should re-examine it. The woman is desperate and has threatened to go to the embassy door and commit suicide,” explains López de la Usada.
“The fact that they are women and Afghans at this time should be enough to grant them protection,” says Queralt Puigoriol, a volunteer with Afghan Women on the Run, an organization that has managed to bring 700 Afghan families to Spain, in an interview with this newspaper. “But at the moment Afghanistan is neither an emergency nor a priority. It doesn’t matter what laws the Taliban make,” she adds.
When was the last time there was a major demonstration in Spain to denounce the oppression and harassment suffered by Afghan women? Even long-time activists can’t remember. “We must continue supporting women and their organizations inside and outside Afghanistan, gather strong support for the campaigns and put more pressure on governments, and these on the UN General Assembly and the Security Council. It was achieved in South Africa. It took more than 20 years, though. Hopefully here we won’t have to wait so long,” says Estrada Tanck.
Meanwhile in Kabul, Soraya, a 53-year-old mother who has worked as a teacher for almost 30 years, watches from her home as society crumbles. “I believe that teaching has transformed the lives of many of my students. We cannot become a country where half of the population does not receive education. I hope that the international community will do something to save our society from ignorance,” she tells this newspaper.

"https://english.elpais.com/culture/2024-09-15/the-women-from-all-walks-of-life-who-rebelled-against-the-nazis.html","2024-09-15","The women from all walks of life who rebelled against the Nazis","An exhibition in Berlin pays tribute to the small acts of resistance by anonymous individuals of various social classes and ideologies who risked their lives to confront National Socialism","Sophie Scholl wrote one word on the back of the indictment that condemned her to death: “freedom.” The story of this university student who defended her ideas against Adolf Hitler’s regime is one of the most heartbreaking in Nazi Germany. The young woman was part of a group called the White Rose, which distributed leaflets with messages against the Third Reich until it was discovered by the Gestapo. All its members were sentenced to death by guillotine. Sophie was only 21 years old. Today, in practically every German city, there is a school named after her, as she has become a powerful symbol of peaceful resistance.
When Germans remember the women who rebelled against National Socialism, they think of Scholl, or Marlene Dietrich, the Hollywood star who used her fame to tell the world what kind of monster Hitler was. But there were hundreds of women from different social strata and ideologies who risked their lives to fight fascism. While the role of men in the resistance is very well documented, that of women has always been less known, something that Johannes Tuchel, director of the German Resistance Memorial Center, describes as “shameful for German historiography.” “After the war, the unwillingness of women to testify was compounded by a lack of interest on the part of academic research,” he notes.
The exhibition Women in Resistance against National Socialism, which will be on display in Berlin until November, is a way of settling this historical debt by bringing to the surface stories of women who had been forgotten. Their portraits are now displayed on the facade of the center, a monumental complex built by the Nazis off the beaten tourist track in Berlin. The symbolically charged building is the site where 80 years ago, Colonel Claus Schenk von Stauffenberg and other leaders of the failed July 1944 Operation Valkyrie conspiracy to assassinate Hitler were executed.
The comprehensive permanent exhibition is now joined by this exhibition, the result of a commission by the German parliament. In 2019, the Bundestag expressly recognized “the courage and achievements of women in the resistance against National Socialism” and earmarked funding for the laborious task of tracing and documenting thousands of life stories.
The women who fought in the resistance ranged from daughters of bankers and high-ranking military officers to teachers, secretaries, illustrators and domestic workers; from trade unionists, anarchists, communists, and socialists to Catholics, Protestants and Jehovah’s Witnesses. The exhibition includes 32 portraits representative of this diversity, while the Frauen im Widerstand website offers access to another 300, with photographs and preserved documentation including letters, postcards, or the court sentences against those who were arrested.
They were all united in their opposition to National Socialism, which sought to confine them to a life of subjugation. “National Socialist ideology reduced women to the role of mothers and housewives,” said State Secretary for Culture Claudia Roth at the inauguration of the exhibition: “They were supposed to stay away from politics, have children and raise them, and take care of the family. Leadership positions in the state, party, economy and society were reserved for men.” The exhibition displays propaganda from the Nazi era that extols the figure of the housewife and women’s work in factories, which became necessary when the men were at the front.
Standing up to the regime was doubly heroic for them. The housewife Elise Hampel, together with her husband Otto, spread hundreds of postcards all over Berlin denouncing Hitler’s government. Her case inspired the popular novel Alone in Berlin by Hans Fallada, which has been made into a film several times. Communist teacher Hilde Radusch and her severely disabled partner, Else Klopsch, defied the authorities by offering help to Jews.
Others participated in wider networks. Freya von Moltke, a banker’s daughter, worked with her husband in the Kreisau Circle, a group of socialists and conservatives discussing how Germany would be reorganized after the end of the Third Reich. Secretary Maria Terwiel, advertising illustrator Elisabeth Schumacher, secretary Rose Schlösinger, and Communist clerk Hilde Coppi (whose life was made into a film this year) collaborated with anti-Nazi resistance groups called the Red Orchestra, which incited civil disobedience, helped Jews and dissidents escape, and supplied information to the Allies.
Others simply made the fatal mistake of voicing their criticism of the Führer out loud. Like the seamstress Elfriede Scholz, sister of Erich Maria Remarque (author of the anti-war novel All Quiet on the Western Front, which was banned by the Nazis) and a staunch anti-Nazi who called German soldiers cattle for slaughter and wished death on Hitler while talking to a customer. Shortly afterwards, she was betrayed.
Marlene Dietrich was perhaps the resistance’s greatest international loudspeaker. She became a Hollywood icon and was tirelessly active against the Third Reich: she committed herself to the emigration of Jews and politically persecuted people and financed the fight against the Nazis. “Boys, don’t sacrifice yourselves! War is bullshit and Hitler is an idiot,” she told Wehrmacht soldiers in 1944.
“Resistance encompasses all actions aimed at damaging the National Socialist movement. This includes, for example, the writing or distribution of criticism, participation in banned parties and organizations, but also enthusiastic individual criticism and aid to Jewish victims,” says Dagmar Lieske, curator of the exhibition.
This romanticized image of women as guardians of the home was evidently limited to women who fit into the popular community, or Volksgemeinschaft, the ideal totalitarian society advocated by the Nazis. The rest were left out: both those who lived non-conformist lives and those who did not meet racial criteria. These — Jews, Gypsies, the disabled — were stripped of their rights and persecuted.
From the moment they came to power in 1933, the Nazis severely suppressed any form of political resistance and began sending communist, social democratic and trade unionist women to concentration camps. By 1945, civil courts and so-called people’s courts had handed down 15,000 death sentences, most of which were carried out.
The young stenographer Liselotte Hermann, arrested for supplying information to the outlawed Communist Party, was the first mother and resistance fighter to be beheaded in Berlin’s infamous Plötzensee prison in 1938. The exhibition also commemorates unknown figures, such as the number of women whose children were taken from them after being sentenced. Between 1939 and the end of the war, more than 120,000 women were confined in the Ravensbrück concentration camp. Over 25,000 died, either killed outright or from the inhumane living conditions.
Resistance activity became particularly dangerous from the winter of 1942-1943 onwards. The defeat of Reich troops by the Soviet army in the decisive Battle of Stalingrad marked a further escalation of repression in Germany. The Nazi leadership wanted to preserve internal stability at all costs.
“From that time on, most of the death sentences against women were for so-called subversion of the defense forces. In reality, behind this accusation was the ruthless suppression of any criticism of the system,” explains Tuchel. Activities that were previously punishable by imprisonment now carried the death penalty. This and other legal tricks were used to sentence them to death. In 1942, Schumacher was convicted and beheaded, followed in 1943 by Scholl, Hampel, Terwiel, Scholz, Coppi, and Schlösinger.
Others, such as Von Moltke, Radusch, and Klopsch, managed to avoid conviction or arrest. The aristocrat Erika von Tresckow, who collaborated with her husband General Henning von Tresckow in the Valkyrie conspiracy to assassinate Hitler, convinced the authorities that she knew nothing of the plot against the Führer.
For Roth, a member of the Greens, the example of the women in the exhibition is especially pertinent today in the face of those who use hate speech and fear to divide society: “These women challenge us to use our room for maneuver here and now to protect, defend, and preserve democracy.”

"https://english.elpais.com/international/2024-09-15/kids-who-migration-left-behind-the-challenging-rescue-of-children-who-have-been-victims-of-violence-in-mexico.html","2024-09-15","Kids who migration left behind: The challenging rescue of children who have been victims of violence in Mexico","Advocate Fabiola Mancilla has brought 25 minors who have been separated from their parents and left in vulnerable situations over to the United States","Eva Clemente was born in Cuba Libre, a town of just over 700 inhabitants where “women are not free.” Those aren’t my words, they’re hers. Clemente’s father sold her for food when she was 12 years old to another family from the municipality of Xalpatlahuac, in the Mexican state of Guerrero. She was only allowed to return home on the day her father died, after getting permission to attend his funeral. Now, in a room in her new apartment in the Bronx, the only photo that hangs on the wall is that of her dad, an older man in a sombrero and plaid shirt who Clemente says she understands, despite everything.
“My father wanted to find me a place for when he was no longer around,” she says. “He wanted to leave me in good hands. But that’s not what happened, he left me in the hands of worthless people. People who made my life miserable from the ages of 12 to 26.”
That’s why the day her mother-in-law called New York from Mexico and told her that she was going to sell her 14-year-old daughter, Clemente planned the girl’s escape, along with that of her five-year-old son, who Clemente had left in the care of their grandmother the day she departed for the United States. In Ñuu Savi, the “town of rain,” paternal families had the power to decide the fate of their women. “I was a servant in their home. I was not the daughter-in-law,” she says.
Sixteen years later, Clemente remembers the sharp sensation of the chile de árbol on the day her father sold her. They gave her a handful to grind as a test, an examination, a confirmation of the fact that she would be a good woman for their children. “It is very difficult to grind chile de árbol, because it is so spicy,” she says. “I had to hide so that I didn’t cry in front of the lady.”
No one saw Clemente cry from the heat, and so she moved to her new family’s house. After a time, she got together with one of their sons, who was two years older than her. Then she got pregnant. “We thought that things were going to go so well, but that wasn’t the case,” she says. “The father of my daughter came to the United States, he left me pregnant. I waited for him. I respected my relationship.”
Her partner returned nine years later, after living in New York while Clemente had stayed under the command of her mother-in-law, who flung the pots on the floor if the food burned and did not allow her to visit her parents’ home. One day, when Clemente was in the kitchen, she heard her little girl cry out.
“Her father was striking her with a cable,” she recalls. “I didn’t like that. I went to defend my daughter. She was 10 years old. I took my daughter out of his hands, I told him not to hit her. Hit me if you want, but don’t mess with her. Then her grandmother arrived and she told me not to get involved, that she was his daughter. I realized that nothing was going to work with him.”
One morning, her mother-in-law asked her to prepare tortillas for a journey. Clemente asked her who was going on a trip. Her mother-in-law told her that her son was heading back to New York. Clemente was pregnant for the second time. “He never told me or warned me that he would leave, that he was going. He said he was leaving because he didn’t have any money. I told him that money comes and goes, that even if we have to eat tortillas with salt, family is the most important thing. But that, if he wanted to go, he must not be used to being at home anymore. I told him: it’s fine, go for it.”
When Clemente’s youngest child was two years old, her partner ordered her to come to New York. And so, Clemente embarked on the journey, like so many before her, after spending nights crying. Her daughter told her, “Mama, don’t go, what’s going to happen to us? Don’t go.”
Clemente got to New York in 2021. It was the first big city she’d ever visited. She lived in an apartment in the Bronx, where she shared the rent with another woman who was also in a relationship with her partner. Three times, in the apartment, Clemente saw them together. “At first, it made me feel bad. I was sad, disappointed. I cried. It was incredibly hard,” she says. “One day I said, that’s it for us. He didn’t like that.”
One night, her partner arrived home drunk and beat her until she lost consciousness. She missed a week of work as a cleaner for a Jewish family in Brooklyn. “He left too many marks, my face was swollen, he left me with my eyes full of blood. He threatened me and told me that if I went to the police, I would never see my children again. Who wouldn’t be scared?”
On another occasion, her partner threw her against a table and when Clemente told him to stop, he told her to get out of the house, that he didn’t want her, warning her that she’d never see her kids. From Mexico, her mother-in-law escalated their feud: she called Clemente a prostitute and only let her speak to her children on the phone if she sent money every week. She told her that if someone came for her daughter, “she’d give her” to anyone who asked. Clemente worked as much as she could to be able to bring her children over: cleaning floors from 7 a.m. to midnight, working in a salon where they paid her poorly, delivering food. Her daughter asked Clemente to help her leave, seriously this time.
At one point in our conversation, Clemente picks up her mobile phone to check on her son, who is making his way home on the school bus that drops him off very close to their Bronx apartment. The children arrived one year ago, when Clemente met Fabiola Mancilla, the director and founder of the organization Pueblos y Comunidades Indígenas Transfronterizos (Indigenous Cross-Border People and Communities, PUCOMIT), a project that since 2023 has helped reunite children who have been victims of violence. Last year, with the help of the project Al Otro Lado (The Other Side), they were able to accompany 20 minors between the ages of two and 17 to the United States, with the authorization of their parents. By September 2024, they had reunited 25 children who had stayed behind in vulnerable situations.
Mancilla says that all the children who have benefited from her project have “a special condition.” “There are children of activists who were assassinated in Guerrero. Another thing that happens a lot in migrant communities is that the mother and father emigrate. It’s important to note that in Indigenous communities, as romantic a view as academics tend to take of them, when you’re a woman and you marry, you become the property of your husband’s family. In those cases, the minors stay with the spouse’s family and that violence is exercised against them. The children become a way of getting money, because you’re the winner since you’re in the United States, and you’re going to have to give me money for me to set your children free,” she says.
The advocate also helped to bring the children of Raúl Rivera from Guerrero to New York. Rivera is an activist and florist in Bushwick who emigrated 13 years ago to the United States, after falling victim to an armed robbery while working as a taxi driver in Tlapa. After the incident, Rivera said he tried “to live a normal life” in his town, but that proved impossible. He received constant threats. Later, he and his wife decided to make the journey north. Their children, at the time four and seven years old, stayed with their grandmother, their parents promising that they’d come back for them.
“The goal was to get them out of there and give them a better life,” says Rivera. “But my family didn’t want us to bring the kids. My mother said, how could we think about putting them at risk like that, that the border was dangerous. It was an empathic ‘no.’ As long as she was alive, it was impossible to get her to let go of them. In a certain way, I understood.”
When his mother died, his children no longer had anyone to take care of them. “I was so desperate that I thought about going back,” he says. The kids eventually arrived with the help of PUCOMIT and Al Otro Lado in February of 2023, when their parents authorized Mancilla to bring them over. “Migration called me, they asked me for basic information. A social worker was making sure that the kids would be OK, that they would have a bed, food in the refrigerator,” he says. “Seeing them arrive was the best thing that’s ever happened to me, I didn’t think it was possible. I realized they were no longer the little kids I’d left behind, but fortunately I was able to receive them while they still had their innocence. Even though I didn’t have enough time to play with them as I would have liked, it soothes me to know that when I get there in the afternoon, knowing they’re there, that they’re alright.”
Twenty-four-year-old Luz Felipe Narcizo arrived in a similar manner with her nine-year-old brother, who lives with HIV. Despite the fact that the authorities forced his sister to sign documents saying he was receiving his prescriptions, the little boy went three months without his medication. “The doctor told me that it hadn’t arrived, that it was impossible to supply so many people. That happens a lot,” she says. “The boy began to get sick, he was getting a lot of nose bleeds, he was running a high fever.”
After getting into contact with Mancilla, Felipe Narcizo and her brother were turned over to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents. Now they live with their mother in New York. “The boy hasn’t had a nosebleed since we arrived, he hasn’t had a fever,” she says.
Recently, the U.S. government admitted that it had lost track of more than 32,000 underage migrants, but that number could be even higher, given that there are 290,000 children who have yet to receive a date for their court hearing. The situation has been blamed on U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)’s shoddy case monitoring.
“I explain to the mothers, fathers and children how difficult our job is and how careful we have to be,” says Mancilla. “Some people think this is a game, that it’s a tourist visa and it’s not like that. What the parents have to decide is where is best for the child and if it’s worth them making such a traumatic journey. Kids on the border cry, they have to be turned over to a stranger who speaks another language. You have to decide whether it’s best for them to stay in their community. This is not a game.”
“Fabiola helped me so much,” says Clemente. One morning, when her kids were on the way to school in Cuba Libre, their mother ordered the oldest to take a taxi to the city of Tlapa. With the help of some people contacted by Clemente, they arrived at the Mexico City international airport, boarded a plane and traveled up to Tijuana, where they stayed in a shelter until being turned over a few days later to CBP agents. By then, their grandmother had figured out that something had happened to them and activated an amber alert. A lawyer called Clemente and asked about the children.
“I told them that I didn’t know what they were talking about,” says Clemente. “Then in the afternoon, they called me and I told the lawyer that I had every right to be with my children. They told me that if I didn’t turn them in within 24 hours, they were coming for me. That’s when I said yes, come for me.”
Clemente’s children got to the United States at the end of May 2023, after spending a week in custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), which has had a program for unaccompanied minors (UC) since 2003 and has provided services or found sponsors for more than 700,000 children. In the 2023 fiscal year, the program received 118,938 kids, of which 76% were over 14 years old and 61% were boys. They primarily came from Guatemala (42%), Honduras (28%), El Salvador (9%), Mexico (8%) and other countries (13%). As of September 2024, 6,448 children are under the agency’s care, according to data from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).
Once they get out of ORR facilities, the children, who are initially released on parole, can apply after six months for Special Immigrant Juvenile (SIJ) status, a step towards lawful permanent residency.
When Clemente finally had her children with her in New York, she saw how “skinny” her little boy was, that he had fleas and a broken rib. “My kids lived through so much with their grandmother. When they arrived, they had that on their minds. My boy got here and said let’s go, if we don’t go to grandma’s house she’s going to beat us. I grabbed him and said, you’re with me, no one is going to do anything to you because you’re with me. That’s why I brought them here.”
Her oldest daughter is in therapy. Her grandmother kept close tabs on her and wouldn’t even let her visit her other grandmother. “Us women are nothing in Mexico, there’s so much suffering,” says Clemente, who had a baby three months ago with her new partner. “I’m OK, I’m at peace, there’s no one to yell at me, threaten me, beat me or tell me to do this or that. It’s hard when they give you away when you’re young, you have your baby when you’re 12 or 13. We are children at that age. And it’s the women themselves who trample on you. That was what I suffered there at the hands of that woman. Now I want tranquility, peace, and to live happily with my children.”

"https://english.elpais.com/economy-and-business/2024-09-15/artificial-intelligence-will-affect-60-million-us-and-mexican-jobs-within-the-year.html","2024-09-15","Artificial intelligence will affect 60 million US and Mexican jobs within the year","IDB study shows the impact that AI will have on the labor market. Women and low-skilled workers are more vulnerable to being replaced","Artificial intelligence’s impact on our lives is already well-known, but now, its most feared consequences related to the job market are setting off alarms. An innovative index created by the Inter-American Development Bank shows that in the United States, 43 million jobs will be affected by the introduction of AI in the space of just one year. In Mexico, that figure stands at 16 million jobs. Over the next five years, those numbers will rise to 60 and 22 million, respectively. In the space of a decade, 70 million jobs in the U.S. will suffer, along with 26 million in its neighboring country.
“These estimates do not directly correspond to job losses, but they do indicate that a large proportion of occupations are vulnerable, and that there is an opportunity to leverage the jobs that will be most affected. We must have a plan for the impact that AI could have,” says Eric Parrado, chief economist at the IDB and co-author of the index.
The AI-Generated Index of Occupational Exposure calculates the potential impact of artificial intelligence on occupations and their associated tasks among more than 750 professions on one, five and 10-year timelines. It is based on large data sets, which it processes and synthesizes quickly, offering an alternative to traditional surveys, which are usually expensive.
According to the index, 980 million jobs around the world will be affected in some way by this new technology within the year. That amounts to 28% of the global workforce. Within five years, that figure will rise to between 38%, and in 10 years, 44%.
Those are compelling numbers, and while they don’t equate to jobs that will be necessarily lost, the fact that AI will impact nearly half of the world’s employment in some way implies that we are looking at a change of a magnitude similar to that which followed the 19th-century industrial revolution. “This is an industrial revolution that is growing exponentially. It’s going to take less time to implement. We must make adjustments quickly and that’s why we are carrying out this research, to send a message of caution,” says Parrado. The goal of the index is to serve as a warning, so that, instead of having negative consequences, AI will bring benefits.
“We are optimistic, we think that technological change will raise productivity. The fact that there will be job replacement doesn’t mean that employment will fall, because there will be opportunities that come up to create new occupations. We’ve seen it happen in the past. We have had very pronounced technological shocks, and they haven’t led to a decrease in employment, but rather a readjustment in the job markets,” says Parrado.
To turn what seems at first glance a crisis in the job market into a benefit, the study’s authors make recommendations that should be followed by companies and governments. Education and training are the factors that will have the highest impact on the success of adapting to this new reality. “We recommend a significant investment in education and re-training programs that should focus on developing skills that are complementary to AI, such as in areas of critical thinking, creativity and emotional intelligence,” says Parrado.
It also recommends supporting groups who are most vulnerable to the change, like women, who will be more deeply impacted due to the kinds of positions they occupy. “Women, in the United States as well as Mexico, are more vulnerable on the three timelines that we studied because they hold more office, administrative, service and support jobs that are vulnerable to AI. 40% of women will be affected by task automation, which is greater than the 38% of men who will be impacted. It’s important that this gender disparity be considered when it comes to setting policy,” says Parrado.
Vulnerability also varies throughout the socioeconomic hierarchy. Workers with less education and those whose jobs require less training will be more affected. When it comes to income, in the United States, people who earn less will be more vulnerable, while in Mexico, the change will impact both working-class and middle-class jobs. “AI could exacerbate global inequality, that’s why we have to act fast,” says Parrado.
The risk also varies by field. Workers whose jobs require more subjective criteria will be more difficult to replace. The index includes a list of the most and least vulnerable positions. In the former category are occupations like telephone operator, telemarketing, credit evaluators, machine operators and travel agencies, among others. In some cases, such as that of telephone operators, 92% of all positions will be affected.
On the other hand, there are some positions that will beat the AI changes, like those tied to sports, teaching and firefighting. One of the innovative aspects of the index is that it differentiates between tasks that each profession performs. It found that there are specialties within each profession that are more easily replaced than others. For example, in the field of medicine, it’s more likely that a radiologist will lose their job as compared to a psychologist, a maxillofacial surgeon or even a nurse.
No analysis has been done on the differences of AI vulnerability by race or origin, but knowing that African Americans and Latinos occupy more low-income jobs, it’s easy to extrapolate that they will be more affected by the development of new technology.
The goal of the IDB study is drive public and private policy towards counteracting the negative effects that AI will bring. In addition to education and training programs for workers to adapt to the transformation, it recommends that governments improve social safety nets, especially in the short term, including instituting more robust employment insurance and subsidies for individual workers to help in their transition to the new labor model. It also advises the promotion of ethical development, support for small businesses, and periodic evaluations of the labor market.
To take on a transformation of this scale, Parrado says that it will also be necessary to adapt educational programs, urging governments to include AI in school curriculums because, “this technological change is here to stay,” he says.

"https://english.elpais.com/health/2024-09-16/immunotherapy-achieves-remarkable-survival-rates-in-a-handful-of-tumors.html","2024-09-16","Immunotherapy achieves remarkable survival rates in a handful of tumors","A new study reveals that almost half of patients with metastatic melanoma treated with these drugs were cancer-free 10 years later","Just 15 years ago, the prognosis for a patient with metastatic melanoma was devastating: there was no way to stop the progression of this aggressive skin cancer and life expectancy was around six months. However, at the beginning of the last decade, the scientific community made a breakthrough and began to change the course of this disease with the introduction of immunotherapy, which consisted of stimulating the body’s own defenses to help them destroy malignant cells. Today, the survival rate of a person with this same skin tumor can exceed 10 years.
Melanoma was the first stop in immunotherapy’s therapeutic revolution of oncology. Following these positive results, immunotherapy was used to treat other tumors, and it ended up changing the prognosis in some types of lung, bladder and breast cancer, among others. After more than a decade in clinical practice, this innovative therapeutic approach — which is still in development and being perfected — has achieved remarkable survival rates in a handful of tumors. A study presented this past weekend in Barcelona during the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress and published simultaneously in the New England Journal of Medicine, reveals that almost half of patients with metastatic melanoma treated with immunotherapy are cancer-free 10 years later.
Experts say that the data highlight the potential of immunotherapy in cancer, but admit that there are still pending tasks, such as refining which patients will benefit most from it and exploring how it can be combined with other medications to optimize results.
A 10-year follow-up study of patients treated with a combination of immune checkpoint inhibitors — a type of immunotherapy that removes the brakes that the tumor puts on the immune system — revealed that this therapeutic approach radically improved the prognosis of the disease and its effect persisted for several years. “The median survival for this population is now a little over six years, and people who are free from cancer progression at three years have a high likelihood of remaining alive and disease-free at the 10-year time point,” Jedd Wolchock, author of the study and oncologist at the New York-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center, said in a statement.
In addition to confirming the long-term survival data, the study also shed light on another of the unknowns that has been troubling oncologists: the long-term impact of immunotherapy. Despite fears of potential health damage from these drugs, the research found no worrying signs of long-term toxicity.
The scientists also reported that when looking at melanoma survival and overall survival from other causes, over the long term, these lines diverge. That is, as they get older and older, melanoma survivors are more likely to die from other causes than from the cancer. “We can now say half of patients treated with this combination therapy will live 10 years or longer without the concern of dying from metastatic melanoma,” said Wolchock.
Other studies presented at the ESMO Congress also showed how immunotherapy improves survival in the most aggressive breast cancer (triple negative) and in muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Specifically, in breast cancer, research shows that, in the early stages, patients with triple-negative tumors treated with a combination of immunotherapy and chemotherapy before surgery and who continue with immunotherapy after surgery, have a higher five-year survival rate (86.6%) than the study participants who received the placebo (81.2%).
“Immunotherapy helps to cure more patients and this is important data because at five years, survival increases significantly: out of every 100 patients, five respond thanks to having received immunotherapy; if we had not given it to them, they would not have been cured,” says Javier Cortés, co-author of the study and director of the International Breast Cancer Center in Barcelona. The oncologist admits that in breast cancer, the results are not expected to be as overwhelming as in melanoma, but he argued: “These are very important data because we are curing more and more patients.”
This research is a boost for immunotherapy in cancer. And although many oncologists are reluctant to say the word “cure,” the researchers of the melanoma study do argue that it has the potential to cure patients. “These results demonstrate the sustained benefit and impact of dual checkpoint inhibitor therapy on the long-term prognosis of patients with advanced melanoma, highlighting the potential for cure in patients who respond to this type of treatment,” lead study author James Larkin said at the Congress.
However, doctors continue to call for caution and, on Sunday, during the ESMO press conference on these advances, Jessica Hassel, an oncologist at the University Hospital of Heidelberg in Germany, asked for the word “cure” to be used with care, especially if the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. “We prefer the word long-term control because there may be latent cells that grow back,” she warned, explaining this can happen up to 20 years later.
Angela Lamarca, an oncologist at the Jiménez Díaz Foundation and spokesperson for ESMO, also called for caution: “I think that when faced with a patient who has had the disease under control for 10 years, we can say that the cancer is chronic or dormant, but I would not speak of remission [or cure] because the truth is that, often it reactivates again later.”
The scientists who spoke to EL PAÍS maintain that immunotherapy — which checkpoint inhibitors, therapeutic vaccines and the revolutionary CAR-T cell therapy — has been a game-changer, and is being used to fight more and more tumors. Enriqueta Felip, head of the Thoracic Tumors and Head and Neck Cancer group at the Vall d’Hebron Institute of Oncology (VHIO) in Spain, says that the use of these drugs “has increased the survival rate” of some lung cancer patients with a poor prognosis: “We are seeing patients who, after five, six and seven years, continue to come to the clinic,” she said.
Pilar Barretina, head of medical oncology at the Catalan Institute of Oncology (ICO) in Girona, has a similar opinion: “We are whispering about cures, but we are seeing patients with long remissions.” The doctor — who specializes in gynecological tumors — says that immunotherapy plays an “important role” in cervical and endometrial cancer, and is the first line of treatment in metastatic phases of both tumors.
Although it is revolutionary, immunotherapy is still not used on every tumor, not does it work in every patient. In fact, overall, only 25% or 30% of patients respond to immunotherapy. Oncologists are trying to understand why it fails in some people or has no effect on certain tumors. “We have to see what mechanisms cause this to happen and how we reverse this lack of efficacy,” admitted Barretina.
A recent study led by scientists at the Institute for Research in Biomedicine of Barcelona (IRB) identified five key characteristics that hinder immunotherapy, including the tumor’s mutational load; the microenvironment surrounding the malignant cells and the cancer’s proliferation capacity. But the study also found that whether a patient had undergone previous treatment was also a factor.
Experts tell EL PAÍS that there needs to be more precision when it comes to identifying the patients who will benefit the most from immunotherapy, and argue that different combinations of drugs should be tested with immunotherapy to optimize its potential. Barretina also adds that there also needs to be more research into treatment time: “How long should immunotherapy be administered? And if it is stopped, will it be effective when restarted in all cases that had previously responded?” he asked.
Research is still ongoing, but the outlook is optimistic. Lamarca highlights the potential of the new immunotherapy strategies under development — such as cell therapy or bispecific drugs — which are seeking to target tumors (pancreatic tumors, for example) that have been resistant until now. “Immunotherapy still has a long way to go,” he agrees.

"https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2024-09-15/intestinal-fluids-for-baby-cockroaches-and-mothers-devoured-by-their-young-childcare-among-insects.html","2024-09-15","Intestinal fluids for baby cockroaches and mothers devoured by their young: Childcare among insects","Bugs’ parental instincts run the gamut and in many cases, have evolved out of a necessity to defend against a variety of threats","If at some point you see a cockroach with a bundle stuck to its abdomen, rest assured that it is a female protecting its young, as its species has done for millennia. Many of these insects create special capsules called oothecas, where they carry their eggs until their nymphs are born and become independent. A study published in 2018 found ootheca fossils in northeast China that were more than 115 million years old.
Parental care among insects is not just ancient, it’s also incredibly ample and diverse. It has often evolved with the goal of protecting against different threats and takes on all imaginable forms. In this article, we’ll get to know some of its most extreme examples.
As the ectothermic animals they are, insects can’t generate their own heat, and this is one of the primary challenges they face when it comes to surviving in adverse climates. Given that in many cases climate change is leading to more extreme meteorological phenomena, it’s of utmost importance that we understand how parental care can be a buffering mechanism for variations in ambient temperature.
One species of burying beetle (Nicrophorus vespilloides), prevalent in the Northern hemisphere, breeds on the carcasses of small vertebrates. When their larvae hatch, they feed on the carcass, an act of continuing parental care. A team of researchers discovered that without the care of the females, the larvae of this beetle manage to survive at a temperature of 68ºF — but not as low as 59ºF, as they would under the supervision of their parents. Scientists believe that this may be due to competition that takes place at this temperature between the larvae and microorganisms. That is to say, when mothers are present, they can control the microorganism population, thus allowing their offspring to live at lower temperatures.
The burying beetle doesn’t just help when temperatures are low. It also feeds its larvae by regurgitating carrion when its young cannot yet eat on their own. When the carcass is too small to feed all the larvae, their parents eat some of them.
The former of these care methods is reminiscent of how birds incubate their chicks and bring food to them. But there are other insects that are more mammalian in style. The cockroach Cryptocercus punctulatus feeds on wood. When its nymphs are too young to process this feed for themselves, they drink from their parents’ gut fluids, resembling suckling pigs. This allows the young to acquire the intestinal flagella necessary for cellulose digestion.
The beewolf (Philanthus Triangulum) is a species of wasp that got its name for a good reason: females hunt bees, paralyzing them and bringing them home to feed their young. They are often found in warm and humid environments, which have a high risk of food spoilage. To preserve their feed, the mother applies chemical secretions that reduce fungal growth.
Sometimes, merely providing food is not enough, which is why cuckoo flies (Miltogramminae) are also pointedly named. Like the cuckoo, they deposit their young in other animals’ nests — in this case, wasp dens, killing the immature wasps and allowing their own young to eat their food supplies. To avoid this distressing fate, wasp mothers make regular visits to their nests not only to provide food, but also to clean them of fly larvae.
But perhaps the most extreme case of food supply is that of the humpback earwig (Anechura harmandi). The nymphs kill and eat their mother before leaving the nest. These mothers do not attempt to escape the cannibalism, nor do they produce a second brood when isolated from their nymphs. (Now, that’s a committed parent.)
Among some insects, child-raising duties can be so laborious that they require the participation of both parents. The aforementioned burying beetle is monogamous and moms as well as dads help with caring for young. She tends to be in charge of feeding and he, security, although both defend their offspring by attacking intruders in tandem. Those predators can even be other burying beetles, since in this species, infanticide is common.
Another well-known case of biparental care is that of the Australian rhinoceros cockroach (Macropanethia rhinoceros), the biggest cockroach in the world. Adults mate in the burrow and feed their young with leaves and droppings they gather as a team. The animal is so curious that in Australia, it is sold as a pet, and there are guides dedicated to teaching individuals about their proper care.
Since we’ve gotten this far, we would be amiss not to mention the famous communal broods of bees, ants and termites. In the case of yet another giant Australian bug, the termite Mastotermes darwiniensis, the king and queen produce excretions with which they feed their worker offspring so that they stay in the nest and help with household chores.
Lesser known is the behavior of the bedbug Elasmucha grisea. They are often attacked by predators like ants, who devour their eggs. Since there is strength in numbers, several females will gather to be able to defend themselves more effectively.
Other female bedbugs (Gargaphia solani) lay their eggs in the nest of a relative and leave. This does not seem to be a case of parasitism, since it ultimately benefits all involved. On one hand, the bedbug that deposits the eggs does not have to invest energy in caring for them. On the other, one study showed that the brood of the bug left with the extra eggs is more likely to survive should a predator make an appearance, because the intruder will eat a smaller percentage of the augmented number of ovum.
Finally, some insects leave the child-rearing to another species entirely. Such is the case of treehoppers (Membracidae, not to be confused with aphids, which are Aphididae), small insects that suck plant sap and transform it into honey. Females lay their eggs on leaves and take care of their young when they hatch, but in the presence of ants, they abandon their offspring and leave to produce new litters. One study showed that the ants end up protecting this young from predators and, in return, fed on their honey when they matured.
Due to this vast abundance and diversity, insects provide an ideal model for researching the evolution of parental care. It’s curious how little we take them into account when we think of responsible moms and dads.

"https://english.elpais.com/health/2024-09-16/immunotherapy-achieves-remarkable-survival-rates-in-a-handful-of-tumors.html","2024-09-16","Immunotherapy achieves remarkable survival rates in a handful of tumors","A new study reveals that almost half of patients with metastatic melanoma treated with these drugs were cancer-free 10 years later","Just 15 years ago, the prognosis for a patient with metastatic melanoma was devastating: there was no way to stop the progression of this aggressive skin cancer and life expectancy was around six months. However, at the beginning of the last decade, the scientific community made a breakthrough and began to change the course of this disease with the introduction of immunotherapy, which consisted of stimulating the body’s own defenses to help them destroy malignant cells. Today, the survival rate of a person with this same skin tumor can exceed 10 years.
Melanoma was the first stop in immunotherapy’s therapeutic revolution of oncology. Following these positive results, immunotherapy was used to treat other tumors, and it ended up changing the prognosis in some types of lung, bladder and breast cancer, among others. After more than a decade in clinical practice, this innovative therapeutic approach — which is still in development and being perfected — has achieved remarkable survival rates in a handful of tumors. A study presented this past weekend in Barcelona during the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress and published simultaneously in the New England Journal of Medicine, reveals that almost half of patients with metastatic melanoma treated with immunotherapy are cancer-free 10 years later.
Experts say that the data highlight the potential of immunotherapy in cancer, but admit that there are still pending tasks, such as refining which patients will benefit most from it and exploring how it can be combined with other medications to optimize results.
A 10-year follow-up study of patients treated with a combination of immune checkpoint inhibitors — a type of immunotherapy that removes the brakes that the tumor puts on the immune system — revealed that this therapeutic approach radically improved the prognosis of the disease and its effect persisted for several years. “The median survival for this population is now a little over six years, and people who are free from cancer progression at three years have a high likelihood of remaining alive and disease-free at the 10-year time point,” Jedd Wolchock, author of the study and oncologist at the New York-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center, said in a statement.
In addition to confirming the long-term survival data, the study also shed light on another of the unknowns that has been troubling oncologists: the long-term impact of immunotherapy. Despite fears of potential health damage from these drugs, the research found no worrying signs of long-term toxicity.
The scientists also reported that when looking at melanoma survival and overall survival from other causes, over the long term, these lines diverge. That is, as they get older and older, melanoma survivors are more likely to die from other causes than from the cancer. “We can now say half of patients treated with this combination therapy will live 10 years or longer without the concern of dying from metastatic melanoma,” said Wolchock.
Other studies presented at the ESMO Congress also showed how immunotherapy improves survival in the most aggressive breast cancer (triple negative) and in muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Specifically, in breast cancer, research shows that, in the early stages, patients with triple-negative tumors treated with a combination of immunotherapy and chemotherapy before surgery and who continue with immunotherapy after surgery, have a higher five-year survival rate (86.6%) than the study participants who received the placebo (81.2%).
“Immunotherapy helps to cure more patients and this is important data because at five years, survival increases significantly: out of every 100 patients, five respond thanks to having received immunotherapy; if we had not given it to them, they would not have been cured,” says Javier Cortés, co-author of the study and director of the International Breast Cancer Center in Barcelona. The oncologist admits that in breast cancer, the results are not expected to be as overwhelming as in melanoma, but he argued: “These are very important data because we are curing more and more patients.”
This research is a boost for immunotherapy in cancer. And although many oncologists are reluctant to say the word “cure,” the researchers of the melanoma study do argue that it has the potential to cure patients. “These results demonstrate the sustained benefit and impact of dual checkpoint inhibitor therapy on the long-term prognosis of patients with advanced melanoma, highlighting the potential for cure in patients who respond to this type of treatment,” lead study author James Larkin said at the Congress.
However, doctors continue to call for caution and, on Sunday, during the ESMO press conference on these advances, Jessica Hassel, an oncologist at the University Hospital of Heidelberg in Germany, asked for the word “cure” to be used with care, especially if the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. “We prefer the word long-term control because there may be latent cells that grow back,” she warned, explaining this can happen up to 20 years later.
Angela Lamarca, an oncologist at the Jiménez Díaz Foundation and spokesperson for ESMO, also called for caution: “I think that when faced with a patient who has had the disease under control for 10 years, we can say that the cancer is chronic or dormant, but I would not speak of remission [or cure] because the truth is that, often it reactivates again later.”
The scientists who spoke to EL PAÍS maintain that immunotherapy — which checkpoint inhibitors, therapeutic vaccines and the revolutionary CAR-T cell therapy — has been a game-changer, and is being used to fight more and more tumors.

"https://english.elpais.com/economy-and-business/2024-09-15/artificial-intelligence-will-affect-60-million-us-and-mexican-jobs-within-the-year.html","2024-09-15","Artificial intelligence will affect 60 million US and Mexican jobs within the year","IDB study shows the impact that AI will have on the labor market. Women and low-skilled workers are more vulnerable to being replaced","Artificial intelligence’s impact on our lives is already well-known, but now, its most feared consequences related to the job market are setting off alarms. An innovative index created by the Inter-American Development Bank shows that in the United States, 43 million jobs will be affected by the introduction of AI in the space of just one year. In Mexico, that figure stands at 16 million jobs. Over the next five years, those numbers will rise to 60 and 22 million, respectively. In the space of a decade, 70 million jobs in the U.S. will suffer, along with 26 million in its neighboring country.
“These estimates do not directly correspond to job losses, but they do indicate that a large proportion of occupations are vulnerable, and that there is an opportunity to leverage the jobs that will be most affected. We must have a plan for the impact that AI could have,” says Eric Parrado, chief economist at the IDB and co-author of the index.
The AI-Generated Index of Occupational Exposure calculates the potential impact of artificial intelligence on occupations and their associated tasks among more than 750 professions on one, five and 10-year timelines. It is based on large data sets, which it processes and synthesizes quickly, offering an alternative to traditional surveys, which are usually expensive.
According to the index, 980 million jobs around the world will be affected in some way by this new technology within the year. That amounts to 28% of the global workforce. Within five years, that figure will rise to between 38%, and in 10 years, 44%.
Those are compelling numbers, and while they don’t equate to jobs that will be necessarily lost, the fact that AI will impact nearly half of the world’s employment in some way implies that we are looking at a change of a magnitude similar to that which followed the 19th-century industrial revolution. “This is an industrial revolution that is growing exponentially. It’s going to take less time to implement. We must make adjustments quickly and that’s why we are carrying out this research, to send a message of caution,” says Parrado. The goal of the index is to serve as a warning, so that, instead of having negative consequences, AI will bring benefits.
“We are optimistic, we think that technological change will raise productivity. The fact that there will be job replacement doesn’t mean that employment will fall, because there will be opportunities that come up to create new occupations. We’ve seen it happen in the past. We have had very pronounced technological shocks, and they haven’t led to a decrease in employment, but rather a readjustment in the job markets,” says Parrado.
To turn what seems at first glance a crisis in the job market into a benefit, the study’s authors make recommendations that should be followed by companies and governments. Education and training are the factors that will have the highest impact on the success of adapting to this new reality. “We recommend a significant investment in education and re-training programs that should focus on developing skills that are complementary to AI, such as in areas of critical thinking, creativity and emotional intelligence,” says Parrado.
It also recommends supporting groups who are most vulnerable to the change, like women, who will be more deeply impacted due to the kinds of positions they occupy. “Women, in the United States as well as Mexico, are more vulnerable on the three timelines that we studied because they hold more office, administrative, service and support jobs that are vulnerable to AI. 40% of women will be affected by task automation, which is greater than the 38% of men who will be impacted. It’s important that this gender disparity be considered when it comes to setting policy,” says Parrado.
Vulnerability also varies throughout the socioeconomic hierarchy. Workers with less education and those whose jobs require less training will be more affected. When it comes to income, in the United States, people who earn less will be more vulnerable, while in Mexico, the change will impact both working-class and middle-class jobs. “AI could exacerbate global inequality, that’s why we have to act fast,” says Parrado.
The risk also varies by field. Workers whose jobs require more subjective criteria will be more difficult to replace. The index includes a list of the most and least vulnerable positions. In the former category are occupations like telephone operator, telemarketing, credit evaluators, machine operators and travel agencies, among others. In some cases, such as that of telephone operators, 92% of all positions will be affected.
On the other hand, there are some positions that will beat the AI changes, like those tied to sports, teaching and firefighting. One of the innovative aspects of the index is that it differentiates between tasks that each profession performs. It found that there are specialties within each profession that are more easily replaced than others. For example, in the field of medicine, it’s more likely that a radiologist will lose their job as compared to a psychologist, a maxillofacial surgeon or even a nurse.
No analysis has been done on the differences of AI vulnerability by race or origin, but knowing that African Americans and Latinos occupy more low-income jobs, it’s easy to extrapolate that they will be more affected by the development of new technology.
The goal of the IDB study is drive public and private policy towards counteracting the negative effects that AI will bring. In addition to education and training programs for workers to adapt to the transformation, it recommends that governments improve social safety nets, especially in the short term, including instituting more robust employment insurance and subsidies for individual workers to help in their transition to the new labor model. It also advises the promotion of ethical development, support for small businesses, and periodic evaluations of the labor market.
To take on a transformation of this scale, Parrado says that it will also be necessary to adapt educational programs, urging governments to include AI in school curriculums because, “this technological change is here to stay,” he says.

"https://english.elpais.com/people/2024-09-15/prince-harrys-40th-birthday-rudderless-shaken-but-with-an-inheritance-on-the-horizon.html","2024-09-15","Prince Harry’s 40th birthday: rudderless, shaken, but with an inheritance on the horizon","With uninspired work, broken promises and a juicy Netflix contract that is about to expire, estranged from his family and isolated from his friends in the United Kingdom, the youngest son of King Charles is celebrating the start of his fifth decade of life under quite different circumstances","On Sunday, September 15, Prince Harry will have his cake and blow out the candles to celebrate his 40th birthday. Those will be about the only similarities between the date and the party he had 10 years ago. It’s even unlikely that the cake itself, which in 2014 was a UK-standard Eton mess — sponge cake, strawberries and meringue — will be quite the same. Neither will the setting, which will forgo the gray British sky for sunny California’s blue expanse. The royal family won’t be there, and that includes his brother William, his sister-in-law Kate and her sister Pippa, who organized Harry’s fête 10 years ago. This time, he’ll be joined by friends, his two sons and wife Meghan Markle, a name that, 10 years ago, was unknown to the British royal family from which Harry hails. A decade later, that family has split apart.
Nowadays, everything is different in Harry’s life, and has been for the past five years. When his grandmother Queen Elizabeth declined to accept his proposal to live part-time as a civilian while remaining a royal, he decided to strike out on his own, leaving life as he knew it behind. Harry not only left his family, as a mere mortal might have done, but also an institution, its rules, a country and a career. A lifestyle, one might say. Now, entering his fifth decade, he’s still a prince (and always will be), but one without a kingdom. Spotify has dispensed with his services, after being disappointed with the work of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex (“fucking grifters,” one of the platform’s executives called them on a podcast.) No new books have been announced. His workload as chief impact officer of the BetterUp start-up is “zero”. The lifestyle brand that Markle announced five months ago has yet to release a single product or trademark its name with the U.S. Patent Office. Even their Archewell Foundation was found “delinquent” due to administrative error this spring (it is now considered “in good standing”.)
Besides Invictus Games, Harry’s beloved philanthropic initiative held every two years that he founded a decade ago, his most important and lucrative project is his Netflix contract. His first, much-awaited autobiographic series has been their biggest hit; they’ve released two additional projects (one about world leaders and the other, about Invictus) to a lukewarm reception. This week, the platform decreed the December release of Polo, a documentary created by Harry about its titular sport, one of his favorites. A Markle-led cooking program is also in the works, though it has yet to receive a release date. Their contract ends next year. None of the involved parties have made a public statement as to what will happen at that point. According to unconfirmed sources, the couple’s contract totaled some $100 million, suggesting that its loss would be a considerable financial setback. But there is economic hope on the horizon: though Henry already received his parts of his mother’s inheritance in 2009 and 2014, he’s now due part of his grandmother’s estate. According to the British press, the Queen left money to be given to her grandson when he turned 21 years old (at which point he received $7.9 million) and then again when he turns 40. She left him more than William (who came into his inheritance two years ago), knowing that the elder brother would become the Duke of Cornwall, a title that brings with it a comfortable annual salary. Harry’s birthday check, according to The Mirror and The Daily Mail, will be for more than $10.5 million, enough to allow some time to think about his future.
That future, as one of the prince’s former aides put it in an article in The Times featuring several of his acquaintances, is “a bit woolly.” “I always thought he wanted more from life,” the aide told the British publication. “I can’t help but think he must be wondering, ‘Where do I go from here?’” The fifth in line to the British throne recently took a trip — a pseudo-official journey lacking any concrete goal — to Colombia. At the end of September, he’ll participate in parallel activities during the UN General Assembly, giving a talk organized by the Bill Clinton Foundation alongside Matt Damon and chef José Andrés. Random gigs. It seems as though the prince lacks a primary objective, a task. His projects have been ephemeral and haven’t followed a clear line for any considerable amount of time. He is devoted to his children, six-year-old Archie and three-year-old Lilibet, but Harry himself admitted in his documentary that he misses the UK and his lifelong friends. He has no relationship with his father, whom he visited for a brief 45-minute meeting on a whirlwind 24-hour trip to London when Charles announced his cancer diagnosis. He does not speak to Prince William, the throne’s heir apparent. According to the British press, his messages asking to the health of Princess Kate went unanswered. In his interview with ITV’s Tom Bradby a year and a half ago, Harry confessed, “I want my father and brother back. They’ve shown absolutely no willingness to reconcile.”
William, perhaps, feels the most wounded by Harry; and this year, he has bigger worries than his relationship with his brother. As lamented in Harry’s memoir, the life of the youngest son of King Charles III and the deceased Diana of Wales was always that of the spare (as his polemic autobiography was titled.) This was his blessing and his curse. He was allowed to do as he liked, and so he did for many years. Early on, he spent his time with girlfriends, parties, marijuana and doubts. As the years went by, the duties of his title became more concrete: trips to his beloved Africa, the creation of projects like Invictus and the promotion of his interests to his family and country, which at the end of the day were one and the same. Like so many other secondary members of royal families in the 21st century, his was not an easy line to walk, but it was manageable once he seemed to get used to it. Only, it turned out that he was never truly at ease with the position and wound up biting the hand that fed him in a way that caused pain for many in closest circles. His interview with Oprah Winfrey, his series and above all, his memoir, proved to be too much for the king and particularly, the king’s heir, with whom Harry has had no communication for two years, since the death of their grandmother.
Harry has also lost many of his friends, who had formed the backbone of his support system. He’s acknowledged as much, and so have they. In the article published by The Times, they say they don’t understand him, they see him as lost and far-away, beset by a constant nostalgia that has left him fixated on the past. Nor do they understand the interviews, books and reports they see as a betrayal. “The problem for the king and other members of the family is the worry that if they have a chat with Harry, it will appear in Spare volume two. How do you regain the trust? I don’t think Harry ever can,” said one of the king’s close friends, who thinks that Charles could forgive him, but not the other members of the family. In addition, there’s the fact that Harry is waging a judicial war to get the UK to pay for his security, a battle against his father’s government, which may not incline the king towards seeing his side of things.
California is the couple’s last refuge, a place where they are closer to being average citizens than Hollywood stars. They are not the subject of conversation in Santa Barbara (the county in which their town, Montesito, is located) and even less so in Los Angeles, where no one seems to remember them. They don’t attend L.A. parties, meetings or events. Their names are only heard when they’re looking for new publicists, something that occurs frequently because people don’t tend to last long in the position. Their last chief of staff, Josh Kettler, held the job for just three months. In fact, some former employees call themselves the “Sussex Survivors Club,” as documented by The Hollywood Reporter. All Harry has is Montesito, a refuge far from his wars against the British government, the tabloids, his family and the world itself. He’s seen at bookstore events, riding bikes with the kids and going out with new friends for mountain hikes. “I was anxious about 30, I’m excited about 40,” he said in a statement that he sent to the BBC last Friday. “Whatever the age, my mission is to continue showing up and doing good in the world,” he added. He may be a prince without a kingdom, perhaps without even a concrete objective, but at least he has candles to blow out.
